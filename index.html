His many books include <i>The Old Man and the Boy, Poor No More</i>, and <i>The Old Man's Boy Grows Older</i>.</p><h2>The Big O: How to Have Them, Give Them, and Keep Them Coming</h2><p>In her first book, How to Be a Great Lover, bestselling sex educator Lou Paget showed women how to master a man's body. In her second book, How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure, Paget showed men how to please the woman they adore. In this, her third book, Paget shows both sexes how to bring each other to unimaginable heights of sexual excitement&#x2014;together.<br><br>In her first two books, Paget has proven herself to be not only a source of both the most provocative and useful techniques and technical information about sexuality but also an honest and candid voice that men and women have come to rely on. In her nine years of giving Sexuality Seminars, the questions most commonly posed are about orgasms: "Are simultaneous orgasms really possible?" "What can I do if I've never had an orgasm?" "Do only certain types of orgasms 'count'?" In The Big O she answers these questions by debunking the myths and demystifying the questions and confusion surrounding orgasms that can wreak havoc on your sex life, your relationship, or your self-esteem.<br><br>In The Big O Paget provides the most essential and cutting-edge information that will explain and show&#x2014;with explicit step-by-step instructions&#x2014;all you want to know about having an orgasm and giving one, including:<br>&#x2014;The ten different ways that women and the seven different ways men are known to orgasm<br>&#x2014;Tips on how to control the timing and frequency of orgasms <br>&#x2014;Exercises to increase your body's sensitivity and suggestions for women who have never experienced an orgasm to explore and practice privately<br>&#x2014;The real scoop on aphrodisiacs and other orgasm enhancers<br>&#x2014;Emotional enhancers and inhibitors: the psychology of orgasms<br>&#x2014;Physical obstacles to orgasms, including medications, diet, alcohol, and recreational drugs<br>&#x2014;Historical and hysterical facts about orgasms<br>&#x2014;The Kama Lou-Tra: Lou's own look at Tantric sex and the spiritual side of orgasms<br><br>Each chapter contains elucidating and entertaining anecdotes based on research and interviews with thousands of men and women that show readers how the techniques work and what obstacles to avoid.<br>The Big O is a book for men and women of all ages&#x2014;from the time you want to start experiencing the crscendo of an orgasm to the time in your life when having one might not be such an easy feat. With her signature style of fresh information and clear detail, Paget shows you and your partner how to have and give more pleasure than you ever thought possible.</p><p>Did you know that women can orgasm in 10 different ways, and a man in 7 different ways? A new book from sex educator Lou Paget is always a delight. Her frank, positive attitude and sprightly style make her books a pleasure to read. Her other books have focused on the total sexual experience--this one zooms in on the "Big O": orgasm. Of course first you have to understand how your body and your partner's body function sexually, how to build seduction and foreplay into your lovemaking (no matter how long you've been together as a couple), the importance of communication, and myths you need to dispel, so don't expect a whole book of lovemaking technique. In chapters 5 (women's orgasms) and 6 (men's orgasms), she gets to the techniques: lots of them, and clearly illustrated with line drawings.<p> Paget also includes spicy and amusing facts, such as, "Back in the Middle Ages, straight pubic hair was a sign of too much masturbation, which presumably accounts for the wide popularity of miniature pubic hair curlers at the time," and "In 1930 there was a nude indoor bicycle race in Paris in which each woman's goal was to be the first to orgasm from rubbing on the seat."</p><p> Lou Paget is also the author of <i>How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Totally Explicit Techniques That Will Blow His Mind</i> and <i>How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure: Totally Explicit Techniques Every Woman Wants Her Man to Know</i>. Though some information from earlier books is repeated in this one (who minds a reminder about our differences, or an illustration of Ode to Bryan, AKA the Penis Samba?), most is new, or presented in a new way.

The recipes have been chosen for their simple instructions, fresh and healthy ingredients and delicious flavour, and are guaranteed to appeal to the fussiest of children. Each recipe is present</p><p>"<p>Amanda Grant is a food writer, broadcaster and mother of three. She has published several books about healthy eating for children, writes the Junior Cooks pages for <i>Delicious</i> magazine, and is passionate about teaching children about good food and how to cook.</p><p>Harriet Russell is a successful illustrator with a particular interest in food and Italy.</p>"The Silver Spoon is a 50-plus-year-old, thousand-page international best-seller that has been called the Italian Joy of Cooking. In this beautifully produced children&#x2019;s version, food writer Grant has greatly reduced the original into an attractive, informative delight. Refreshingly free from overly cutesy language and images (no cloying puns; no meals shaped into animals), this is a title aimed at kids with a serious interest in food, and in this age of Food Network popularity, when grade-schoolers have won James Beard awards, that&#x2019;s a growing audience. The recipes, drawn straight from the original, have been broken out into clearly explained steps, each illustrated with Russell&#x2019;s whimsical drawings on uncluttered pages that include color photos of the finished dishes, which are divided into basic categories, from lunches and snacks to desserts. The focus is on Italian food, of course, but the helpful tips on basic safety and techniques, such as chopping an onion, make this a universal introduction to the kitchen that may also attract grown-ups seeking a less muscle-straining edition of the adult tome.

"Something terrible. And our sources are certain it will be used this coming Saturday morning. They're certain of that."<br><br>"Four days," said retired Colonel James J. Peterson, his voice grave. It was now 5:00 p.m. on Monday.<br><br>The two men sat in Peterson's nondescript office, in a nondescript building in the suburban town of Reston, Virginia, about twenty-five miles from Washington, D.C. There's a misconception that national security operations are conducted in high-tech bunkers filled with sweeping steel and structural concrete, video screens ten feet high and attractive boys and babes dressed by Armani.<br><br>This place, on the other hand, looked like an insurance agency.<br><br>The skinny man, who worked for the government, added, "We don't know if we're talking conventional, nuke or something altogether new. Probably mass destruction, we've heard. It can do quote 'significant' damage.'"<br><br>"Who's behind this weapon? Al-Qaeda? The Koreans? Iranians?"<br><br>"One of our enemies. That's all we know at this point...So, we need you to find out about it. Money is no object, of course."<br><br>"Any leads?"<br><br>"Yes, a good one&#x2014;an Algerian who knows who formulated the weapon. He met with them last week in Tunis. He's a professor and journalist."<br><br>"Terrorist?"<br><br>"He doesn't seem to be. His writings have been moderate in nature. He's not openly militant. But our local sources are convinced he's had contact with the people who created the weapon and plan to use it."<br><br>"You have a picture?"<br><br>A photograph appeared as if by magic from the slim man's briefcase and slid across the desk like a lizard.<br><br>Colonel Peterson leaned forward.<br><br><em>Tuesday</em><br><br>Chabbi music drifted from a nearby caf�, lost intermittently in the sounds of trucks and scooters charging frantically along this commercial street of Algiers.<br><br>The driver of the white van, a swarthy local, stifled a sour face when the music changed to American rock. Not that he actually preferred the old-fashioned, melodramatic chabbi tunes or thought they were more politically or religiously correct than Western music. He just didn't like Britney Spears.<br><br>Then the big man stiffened and tapped the shoulder of the man next to him, an American. Their attention swung immediately out the front window to a curly-haired man in his thirties, wearing a light-colored suit, walking out of the main entrance of the Al-Jazier School for Cultural Thought.<br><br>The man in the passenger seat nodded. The driver called "Ready" in English and then repeated the command in Berber-accented Arabic. The two men in the back responded affirmatively.<br><br>The van, a battered Ford that sported Arabic letters boasting of the city's best plumbing services, eased forward, trailing the man in the light suit. The driver had no trouble moving slowly without being conspicuous. Such was the nature of traffic here in the old portion of this city, near the harbor.<br><br>As they approached a chaotic intersection, the passenger spoke into a cell phone. "Now."<br><br>The driver pulled nearly even with the man they followed, just as a second van, dark blue, in the oncoming lane, suddenly leapt the curb and slammed directly into the glass window of an empty storefront, sending a shower of glass onto the sidewalk as bystanders gaped and came running.<br><br>By the time the crowds on rue Ahmed Bourzina helped the driver of the blue van extricate his vehicle from the shattered storefront, the white van was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Neither was the man in the light suit.<br><br><em>Wednesday</em><br><br>Colonel James Peterson was tired after the overnight flight from Dulles to Rome but he was operating on pure energy.<br><br>As his driver sped from DaVinci airport to his company's facility south of the city, he read the extensive dossier on the man whose abduction he had just engineered. Jacques Bennabi, the journalist and part-time professor, had indeed been in direct communication with the Tunisian group that had developed the weapon, though Washington still wasn't sure who the group was exactly.<br><br>Peterson looked impatiently at his watch. He regretted the day-long trip required to transport Bennabi from Algiers to Gaeta, south of Rome, where he'd been transferred to an ambulance for the drive here. But planes were too closely regulated nowadays. Peterson had told his people they <em>had </em>to keep a low profile. His operation here, south of Rome, was apparently a facility that specialized in rehabilitation services for people injured in industrial accidents. The Italian government had no clue that it was a sham, owned ultimately by Peterson's main company in Virginia: Intelligence Analysis Systems.<br><br>IAS was like hundreds of small businesses throughout the Washington area that provided everything from copier toner to consulting to computer software to the massive U.S. government.<br><br>IAS, though, didn't sell office supplies.<br><br>Its only product was information and it managed to provide some of the best in the world. IAS obtained this information not through high-tech surveillance but, Peterson liked to say, the old-fashioned way:<br><br>One suspect, one interrogator, one locked room.<br><br>It did this very efficiently.<br><br>And completely illegally.<br><br>IAS ran black sites.<br><br>Black site operations are very simple. An individual with knowledge the government wishes to learn is kidnapped and taken to a secret and secure facility outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. The kidnapping is known as extraordinary rendition. Once at a black site the subject is interrogated until the desired information is learned. And then he's returned home&#x2014;in most cases, that is.<br><br>IAS was a private company, with no official government affiliation, though the government was, of course, its biggest client. They operated three sites&#x2014;one in Bogot�, Colombia, one in Thailand and the one that Peterson's car was now approaching: the largest of the IAS sites, a nondescript beige facility whose front door stated <em>Funzione Medica di Riabilitazione.</em><br><br>The gate closed behind him and he hurried inside, to minimize the chance a passerby might see him. Peterson rarely came to the black sites himself. Because he met regularly with government officials it would be disastrous if anyone connected him to an illegal operation like this. Still, the impending threat of the weapon dictated that he personally supervise the interrogation of Jacques Bennabi.<br><br>Despite his fatigue, he got right to work and met with the man waiting in the facility's windowless main office upstairs. He was one of several interrogators that IAS used regularly, one of the best in the world, in fact. A slightly built man, with a confident smile on his face.<br><br>"Andrew." Peterson nodded in greeting, using the pseudonym the man was known by&#x2014;no real names were ever used in black sites. Andrew was a U.S. soldier on temporary leave from Afghanistan.<br><br>Peterson explained that Bennabi had been carefully searched and scanned. They'd found no GPS chips, listening devices or explosives in his body. The colonel added that sources in North Africa were still trying to find whom Bennabi had met with in Tunis but were having no luck.<br><br>"Doesn't matter," Andrew said with a sour smile. "I'll get you everything you need to know soon enough."<br><br>Jacques Bennabi looked up at Andrew.<br><br>The soldier returned the gaze with no emotion, assessing the subject, noting his level of fear. A fair amount, it seemed. This pleased him. Not because Andrew was a sadist&#x2014;he wasn't&#x2014;but because fear is a gauge to a subject's resistance.<br><br>He assessed that Bennabi would tell him all he wanted to know about the weapon within four hours.<br><br>The room in which they sat was a dim, concrete cube, twenty feet on each side. Bennabi sat in a metal chair with his hands behind him, bound with restraints. His feet were bare, increasing his sense of vulnerability, and his jacket and personal effects were gone&#x2014;they gave subjects a sense of comfort and orientation. Andrew now pulled a chair close to the subject and sat.<br><br>Andrew was not a physically imposing man, but he didn't need to be. The smallest person in the world need not even raise his voice if he has power. And Andrew had all the power in the world over his subject at the moment.<br><br>"Now," he said in English, which he knew Bennabi spoke fluently, "as you know, Jacques, you're many miles from your home. None of your family or colleagues know you're here. The authorities in Algeria have learned of your disappearance by now&#x2014;we're monitoring that&#x2014;but do you know how much they care?"<br><br>No answer. The dark eyes gazed back, emotionless.<br><br>"They don't. They don't care at all. We've been following the reports. Another university professor gone missing. So what? You were robbed and shot. Or the Jihad Brother-ship finally got around to settling the score for something you said in class last year. Or maybe one of your articles upset some Danish journalists...and they kidnapped and killed you." Andrew smiled at his own cleverness. Bennabi gave no reaction. "So. No one is coming to help you. You understand? No midnight raids. No cowboys riding to the rescue."<br><br>Silence.<br><br>Andrew continued, unfazed, "Now, I want to know about this weapon you were discussing with your Tunisian friends." He was looking carefully at the eyes of the man. Did they flicker with recognition? The interrogator believed they did. It was like a shout of acknowledgment. Good.<br><br>"We need to know who developed it, what it is and who it's going to be used against. If you tell me, you'll be back home in twenty-four hours." He let this sink in. "If you don't...things won't go well."<br><br>The subject continued to sit passively. And silent.<br><br>That was fine with Andrew; he hardly expected an immediate confession. He wouldn't want one, in fact. You couldn't trust subjects who caved in too quickly.<br><br>Finally he said, "Jacques, I know the names of all your colleagues at the university and the newspaper where you work."<br><br>This was Andrew's talent&#x2014;he had studied the art of interrogation for years and knew that people could much more easily resist threats to themselves than to their friends and family. Andrew had spent the past two days learning every fact he could about people close to Bennabi. He'd come up with lists of each person's weaknesses and fears. It had been a huge amount of work.<br><br>Over the next few hours Andrew never once threatened Bennabi himself; but he was ruthless in threatening his colleagues. Ruining careers, exposing possible affairs, questioning an adoption of a child...Even suggesting that some of his friends could be subject to physical harm.<br><br>A dozen specific threats, two dozen, offering specific details: names, addresses, offices, cars they drove, restaurants they enjoyed.<br><br>But Jacques Bennabi said not a word.<br><br>"You know how easy it was to kidnap you," Andrew muttered. "We plucked you off the street like picking a chicken from a street vendor's cage. You think your friends are any safer? The men who got you are back in Algiers, you know. They're ready to do what I say."<br><br>The subject only stared back at him.<br><br>Andrew grew angry for a moment. He cleared his raw throat and left the room, had a drink of water, struggled to calm down.<br><br>For three more hours he continued the interrogation. Bennabi paid attention to everything Andrew said, it seemed, but he said nothing.<br><br>Goddamn, he's good, Andrew thought, struggling not to reveal his own frustration. He glanced at his watch. It had been nearly nine hours. And he hadn't uncovered a single fact about the weapon.<br><br>Well, it was time to get serious now.<br><br>He scooted the chair even closer.<br><br>"Jacques, you're not being helpful. And now, thanks to your lack of cooperation, you've put all your friends at risk. How selfish can you be?" he snapped.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>Andrew leaned close. "You understand that I've been restrained, don't you? I had hoped you'd be more cooperative. But apparently you're not taking me seriously. I think I have to prove how grave this matter is."<br><br>He reached into his pocket. He pulled out a printout of a computer photograph that had been taken yesterday.<br><br>It showed Bennabi's wife and children in the front yard of their home outside of Algiers.<br><br><em>Thursday</em><br><br>Colonel Peterson was in his hotel room in the center of Rome. He was awakened at 4:00 a.m. by his secure cell phone.<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Colonel." The caller was Andrew. His voice was ragged.<br><br>"So, what'd he tell you?"<br><br>"Nothing."<br><br>The colonel muttered, "You just tell me what he said and <em>I'll </em>figure out if it's important. That's <em>my </em>job." He clicked the light on and fished for a pen.<br><br>"No, sir, I mean, didn't say a single word."<br><br>"Not a...word?"<br><br>"Over sixteen hours. Completely silent. The entire time. Not one goddamn word. Never happened in all my years in this business."<br><br>"Was he getting close to breaking, at least?"<br><br>"I...No, I don't think so. I even threatened his family. His children. No reaction. I'd need another week. And I'll have to make good on some of the threats."<br><br>But Peterson knew they were already on shaky ground by kidnapping somebody who was not a known terrorist. He wouldn't dare kidnap or endanger the professor's colleagues, let alone his family.<br><br>"No," the colonel said slowly. "That's all for now. You can get back to your unit. We'll go to phase two."<br><br>The woman was dressed conservatively, a long-sleeved blouse and tan slacks. Her dark blond hair was pulled back and she wore no jewelry.<br><br>Since Bennabi wasn't culturally or religiously conservative, worked with women at the university and had actually written in favor of women's rights, Peterson decided to use Claire for the second interrogator. Bennabi would view her as an enemy, yes, but not as an inferior. And, since it was known that Bennabi had dated and was married, with several children, he was a clearly a man with an appreciation of attractive women.<br><br>And Peterson knew that Claire was certainly that.<br><br>She was also an army captain, in charge of a prisoner-of-war operation in the Middle East, though at the moment she, too, was on a brief leave of absence to permit her to practice her own skills as an interrogator&#x2014;skills very different from Andrew's but just as effective in the right circumstances.<br><br>Peterson now finished briefing her. "Good luck," he added.<br><br>And couldn't help reminding her that it was now Thursday and the weapon would be deployed the day after tomorrow.<br><br>In perfect Arabic, Claire said, "I must apologize, Mr. Bennabi, Jacques...May I use your first name?" She was rushing into the cell, a horrified look on her face.<br><br></p><h2>Home Town</h2><p>In this splendid book, one of America's masters of nonfiction takes us home--into Hometown, U.S.A., the town of Northampton, Massachusetts, and into the extraordinary, and the ordinary, lives that people live there. As Tracy Kidder reveals how, beneath its amiable surface, a small town is a place of startling complexity, he also explores what it takes to make a modern small city a success story. Weaving together compelling stories of individual lives, delving into a rich and varied past, moving among all the levels of Northampton's social hierarchy, Kidder reveals the sheer abundance of life contained within a town's narrow boundaries. Does the kind of small town that many Americans came from, and long for, still exist?&nbsp;&nbsp;Kidder says yes, although not quite in the form we may imagine. A book about civilization in microcosm, <b>Home Town</b> makes us marvel afresh at the wonder of individuality, creativity, and civic order--how a disparate group of individuals can find common cause and a code of values that transforms a place into a home. And this book makes you feel you live there.</p><p>Northampton, Massachusetts, boasts a rich history that dates back to the 17th century. It is home to Mount Holyoke, which has been climbed by Charles Dickens and Henry James (among others), and to Sylvia Plath's alma mater, Smith College. It has always been the quintessential New England town, while becoming in recent years a politically progressive small city, whose population of 30,000 has WASPs rubbing elbows with lesbians, immigrants, students, and the homeless. Driven by a narrative force comparable to that of the best fiction, <i>Home Town</i> is a remarkable evocation of small-town life at the end of the 20th century.<p> Probing beneath Northampton's friendly exterior, Pulitzer-winning author Tracy Kidder uncovers the town's many layers, from the lowest to the highest rungs of society, and renders a portrait of Northampton by introducing those who know it best. Kidder relies most heavily on native Tommy O'Connor, a 33-year-old police sergeant who has never left his beloved hometown. Tommy's optimism and gentle humor make him an appealing guide, as he shows both the darkest and most charming streets of his town and wrestles with a future that may forever alter his relationship to Northampton. Kidder also introduces readers to Laura Baumeister, a young working mother and Ada Comstock scholar at Smith College who is struggling to care for her son and keep up with the rigorous school curriculum; Alan Scheinman, a real estate lawyer who made a fortune in the 1980s, now plagued by a crippling case of obsessive-compulsive disorder; and Samson Rodriguez, a former loom operator who may have been one of the first people to bring crack cocaine to Northampton. <i>--Kera Bolonik</i></p>"Tracy Kidder's gift as a writer is one that is also often associated with certain great center fielders: a grace that makes the difficult look effortless.... The eloquent interplay, not just between history and the present, but between the public and private moments of life, results in a book whose subtle originality is at the service of the deep humanity of its portraiture. I can't think of an American writer who gets that sense of human scale more right, more consistently, than Tracy Kidder."--Stuart Dybek, author of <i>The Coast of Chicago</i><p><i></i>Praise for <b>House</b><br>"This book is the story of the building of a house, and it is told with such clarity, intelligence, and grace it makes you wonder why no one has written a book like it before. In the way that a well-told story of a marriage or of a love affair or of a child's coming of age fills you with a sense that you are reading about a fundamental human experience for the first time, so it is with House."--Paul Goldberger, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p><b>The Soul of a New Machine</b></p><p>"Kidder has endowed the tale with such pace, texture and poetic implication that he has elevated it to a high level of narrative art....Splendid."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p><b>Old Friends</b></p><p>"Sheer magic." --Walter Shapiro, <i>Time</i></p><p><b>Among Schoolchildren</b><br>"Tracy Kidder can turn the most unlikely story into a riveting drama." --Anne Tyler</p></p><h2>1633 (Assiti Shards)</h2><p>Hurtled back in time into the Thirty Years War by an unknown force, Mike Stearns and his fellow West Virginia coal miners join forces with the king of Sweden to form the Confederated Principalities of Europe and take on the scheming Cardinal Richelieu as they struggle to rescue Mike&#39;s wife from war-torn Amsterdam and his sister from the Tower of London.</p><p><b>David Weber</b> is best known for his New York Times bestselling Honor Harrington series, arguably the most popular series in science fiction, which has led to reviewers comparing him to C.S. Forester , celebrated creator of Captain Horatio Hornblower. Weber's work ranges from epic fantasy (Oath of Swords, The War God's Own] to breathtaking space opera (Path of the Fury, The Armageddon Inheritance] to military science fiction with in-depth characterization (the Honor Harrington novels). With John Ringo, he inaugurated the Prince Roger series of space adventures with March Upcountrij and has continued it with March to the Sea. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina. <p><b>Eric Flint</b> is a new master of alternate-history science fiction. His 1632, prequel to 1633, received lavish critical praise from all directions and enjoyed high sales. His first novel, Mother of Demons, was picked by Science Fiction Chronicle as a best novel of the year. He has also shown a powerful gift for humorous fantasy adventure with Forward the Mage and The Philosophical Strangler, which Booklist described as "Monty Python let loose in Tolkien's Middle Earth." With David Drake he has collaborated on five novels in the popular Belisarius series, the next of which will be The Dance of Time. A longtime labor union activist with a Master's Degree in history, he currently resides in Indiana with his wife Lucille.</p>In this worthy sequel to the well-received 1632 (2000), about a small West Virginia coal-mining town transported back in time to the Germany of the Thirty Years War, original author Flint and coauthor Weber resist the temptation to use modern technology to impose a Pax Americana, instead allowing their transportees just enough high tech to prevail if they can win allies like Sweden's King Gustavus Adolphus. Most of the current book deals with coalition building, as the visitors from the future attempt to remake their new world into one safe for democracy despite opposition from such as Cardinal Richelieu. History books from a now-hypothetical future and antibiotics prove to be more potent than their limited supply of modern firearms, but the most powerful weapons of the new "United States" are its ideas, which now infect the millions of Germans ground under the heels of their princes. Ordinary Germans develop a new faith in themselves and their future when the Americans show them that they can do anything, even fly. Flint, a former union organizer, is particularly skilled at showing how the new converts can make even the "old Americans" uncomfortable in their zeal to achieve the blessings of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," while Weber helps smooth out characters who were stereotypes in the first book. This is a thoughtful and exciting look at just how powerful are the ideals we sometimes take for granted, and is highly recommended as a reminder of how we can look to others when at our best. (Aug.) FYI: Weber is also the coauthor with Steve White of The Shiva Option (Forecasts, Jan. 28), while Flint is also the coauthor with David Drake of The Tyrant (Forecasts, Mar. 25). <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mies</h2><p><p>Unprecedented in scope and illustrated with more than 700 original drawings, plans, diagrams, and contemporary and archival photographs, <i>Mies</i> by Detlef Mertins is the most definitive monograph ever published on the modern master of architecture Mies van der Rohe. Mertins&#x2019; rich and highly readable text traces the aesthetic and intellectual context for all Mies&#x2019; work, with in&#x2013;depth discussions of his most important projects. Featuring some of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most iconic buildings, such as the Barcelona Pavilion in Spain, the Crown Hall at IIT, and the Seagram Building in New York, <i>Mies</i> paints a fascinating portrait of the famed architect whose contribution to the modern urban landscape cannot be overlooked.</p></p><p>Detlef Mertins (1954-2011) made lasting contributions to the theory and history of modernism in architecture, art, philosophy, and urbanism. From 2002 to 2007, he was Professor of Architecture and Chair of the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. He also taught at the University of Toronto and, as a visiting professor, at Columbia University, Harvard University, Princeton University and Rice University. Among his many published books are Modernity Unbound (2011); G: An Avant-Garde Journal of Art, Architecture, Design, and Film, 1923-1926 (2010), co-edited with Michael Jennings; The Presence of Mies (1994) and Metropolitan Mutations: The Architecture of Emerging Public Spaces (1989). Mertins also published numerous essays in scholarly journals and anthologies, as well as critical writings on contemporary architecture.<p>"Puts Mies&#x2019;s work back at the center of the architectural debate." &#x2013; <b>Barry Bergdoll, Acting Chief Curator of Architecture and Design at MoMA</b></p><p>"A formidable commitment to understanding both the man and the work." &#x2013; <b>John Pawson</b></p><p>"By providing a rich texture of details, Professor Mertins succeeds in making his book an enlightening and enjoyable journey for both serious students of architecture and design as well as those interested in learning more about the creative genius [Mies van der Rohe]." &#x2013; <b>Maurice D. Parrish, Executive Director of the Farnsworth House</b></p><p>"Do we need another book on the master of universal space, heir to the Platonic ideal, and pursuer of the perfectly understated environment? For those interested in the intellectual context of the work &#x2014; in Mies as philosopher&#x2013;architect &#x2014; the answer is yes." &#x2013; <b><i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review</b></p><p>"A hulking new monograph" &#x2013; <b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>"Designers and design buffs seeking to understand this giant better make room on their shelves for <i>Mies</i>." &#x2013; <b><i>Interior Design</i></b></p><p>"If you&#x2019;ve been coveting the definitive guide to one of the world&#x2019;s most celebrated architects, this epic volume is worth the splurge." &#x2013; <b><i>The New York Post</i></b></p><p>". . . a fascinating survey of the architect&#x2019;s intellectual concerns: questions of the body and soul, technology and nature, and the individual and the community.

However, Detlef Mertin&#x2019;s new book ought to make the list of the handful of exceptional, definitive volumes. . . Stunning photography, impeccable historical research and an obvious ear for philosophy comprise each of the six sections of its 528 pages, creating a book that is an extraordinary, beautiful intellectual journey and a rethinking of the function of the political in architecture." &#x2013; <b><i>Identity</i></b></p><p>"A monumental monograph on the legendary architect sheds new light on the godfather of modernism." &#x2013; <b><i>Metropolis</i></b></p><p>"What marks out Mertins&#x2019;s study is its unremitting focus on the ideas that shaped Mies&#x2019;s designs, and on how this son of an Aachen stonemason came to create a form of architecture that spoke a universal language and gave a defining three&#x2013;dimensional form to a self&#x2013;consciously modern era." &#x2013; <b><i>The Telegraph</i></b></p><p>"A new generation is discovering that Mies&#x2019;s avocation of craft and quality are key to the architecture of simplicity.

Alert readers will note that something's fishy and may even begin to spot the clues the first time through--even though a second reading will definitely be in order. But the book is still confusing even after another look, and its picture-book format seems too young for kids old enough to follow what's happening. The dramatic jacket and colorful illustrations will attract younger children, but parents of preschoolers may find it tricky to explain that the robin faked his own death to deflect suspicion, then hid the jewels in his coffin to dig up later. In the end, justice prevails, and O'Malley provides young detectives with a list of the visual clues that lead to Cock Robin's capture. As they say about British mysteries, "Too clever by half." <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>A mystery in the classic style, written in verse that mimics the familiar rhyme. A haughty detective--an owl in a pince-nez- -gets a confession from a sparrow plus an eye-witness account from a gardener/magpie; still, it's not so simple--an apparently unrelated jewel heist is involved. Small sleuths will enjoy picking up the clues in the illustrations, though the parody of adult mysteries will surely elude them. O'Malley's brash, bold art is nicely peopled with suspicious looking birds and caricatures, like the old turkey presiding at the trial. Not as cleverly plotted or as elegantly illustrated as Yolen's Piggins series, but with much of the same appeal. (Picture book. 5-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She promises that she will keep real quiet so she won&#x2019;t scare the fish, that she can row a boat without making it turn in circles, and that she can bait a hook . . . maybe. Granddad is convinced and they take a boat out on the water together. There, Sara meets the best fisherman on the lake, learns all of her granddad&#x2019;s fishing secrets, and creates some of her very own.<p> Lyrical with touches of spot-on humor, this story captures the fun and loving relationship between a granddaughter and her grandfather, and their interaction with the natural world.

Mr. Jorisch lives with his wife and three children in Montreal, Canada.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;Sara is visiting her grandparents at their lakeside cottage. When she hears Granddad getting up early in the morning, she jumps up, too, and inquires where he's going. Fishing with his buddy, he says, and Sara convinces him to take her along. As they row across the lake, Sara keeps looking for the buddy, but Granddad just waves to all the other fishermen. She masters her angling skills, with the exception of putting the worm on the hook (she uses a piece of licorice instead). A heron appears and plucks a fish out of the water. Granddad instructs Sara to row over to it and they both start catching fish. When the bird moves to a new location, they follow. Sara realizes that Granddad's fishing buddy is the heron; he stirs up the fish as he wades through the shallows. By the book's end, Granddad has a new fishing buddy: Sara, of course. Done in pencil, watercolor, and gouache, the illustrations are perfect for the tone of the story. The early-morning lake scene is suitably foggy and clears up as the day progresses. The characters, with their bright clothing and smiling faces, stand out nicely from the green and gray tones of the watery backdrops.

As it turns out, this faceless individual is instrumental to the plot. His funeral brings his old circle of friends together, to relive the past and renegotiate the present in the wake of his absence. Each person must reconsider who he or she is, individually and within the group, because of his death. You never meet the man who has died, but you feel his absence, which is actually a presence of sorts. Director Lawrence Kasdan got something right here, something that resonates, about the aftermath of loss. </p><p>The death of someone you love forces you to reconsider who you are. It forces you to belong to a club to which no one wants to be a member, and to which just about everyone, save those who die young, eventually belongs. In her 1978 book, <i>Illness as Metaphor,</i> the writer and critic Susan Sontag writes: "Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick." It's the same way with death. Or rather, being a survivor. Suddenly, ready or not, your membership is activated. It's your turn, it's your journey. What now?</p><p>This book is about my journey and the journey of those who have lost a brother or sister. In 1980, when I was fourteen, my only sibling, my older brother, Ted, died from a rare immune deficiency disease after an eight-year illness, during which he'd had to live in a sterile "bubble" room at The National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. His illness spanned a good portion of my childhood, long enough that it had become normal to me. I was devastated when he died. My life, my very identity, was shattered. But I wouldn't understand that for years. And I wouldn't fully explore my loss until I came to write this book. </p><p>The story of this book began eleven years after Ted's death. At the time, I was working as an editorial assistant at <i>The Washington Post,</i> answering phones, organizing supplies, begging to write small stories, and puzzling over what to do with my life. I'd gotten the job because my father, an oncologist, knew a patient who worked there. Journalism, while not my ambition, was deemed an acceptable form of writing by my parents, because it meant a paycheck. Except what I was doing wasn't really journalism. It was more like standing with my nose pressed against the window. And part of me was still toying with the idea of going to medical school. </p><p>I'd worked in medical research labs from the time I was fifteen until I was nineteen, labs run by one of my brother's former doctors. I was comfortable in the hospital; it felt like home. I knew sickness, death. They were, if not old friends, familiar companions. And a life outside the hospital, not engaged in crisis-saturated life-and-death issues, seemed meaningless. But the idea of being in the hospital for the rest of my life, confronted with a part of my life I also wanted to get past, also made me feel slightly hysterical. Trapped. What I really wanted was to be happy, to be normal. But I had no idea how to make that happen.</p><p>The line between what I felt I should do and what I wanted was hopelessly blurred. I frequently did things to pull the rug out from under myself, just to see if answers would become dislodged in the settling dust. Plus, though I craved normalcy, I was much more comfortable with stress and crisis. I found everyday sameness -- breakfast, lunch, dinner, work, bills, the gym -- unnerving. I struggled with the most mundane tasks. I struggled with relationships. I struggled with an eating disorder. I drank too much. I alternated among bravado, exhibitionism, insecurity, and my "invisible woman" routine. I could make myself so quiet that people missed me in rooms and backed into me in elevators. I observed a lot. I molded my reactions, my behavior, to those around me. I was a chameleon, an actress. I had no idea who I was. </p><p>By the time I was twenty-five and working at the <i>Post,</i> I was old enough to sense that I was both tough and fragile, but not old enough, or wise enough, yet, to know where and how. I abruptly quit my job (the pull-the-rug-out-from-under-myself routine) and called a veteran science writer I knew of. My latest plan was to combine writing with science; I could help people without sentencing myself to a future in the hospital. Calling someone you want a job from, and offering to buy them coffee, is the kind of advice that people give but never act on themselves. But I didn't know any better. Luckily for me, the woman I contacted was amused, and willing to meet. </p><p>I don't know how the subject of our brothers came up. She knew of mine because she was a reporter. In the pre-AIDS days of my brother's illness, before newspapers and magazines were rife with science and health stories, and before health and talk shows regularly trotted out people with rare medical afflictions, my brother's story had been big news. His story, and that of another boy, were combined for an unauthorized 1976 made-for-TV movie called <i>The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.</i> My family regularly got calls from newspapers, from the mainstream to the worst of the tabloids, wanting to write about Ted. <i>The National Enquirer</i> sent a photographer to his funeral. Though we don't get calls anymore, he and this other boy are still strange, abstract figures in American pop culture. Variations of the phrase "boy in the plastic bubble" have appeared in a Paul Simon song, on an episode of <i>Seinfeld,</i> in a movie satire of the first movie, and as the name of a board game.</p><p>This journalist told me she had a brother who died at an age close to my brother's -- seventeen -- of cystic fibrosis. Children with the disease have a better survival rate these days, but when her brother was sick, most didn't live to see their twenties. I don't remember exactly what she told me, or what I said in response. I only remember the eerie sense of resonance. All that time, I had thought I was the only one. I thought losing a sibling was my own strange story. I began to wonder if my struggles had been set in motion by my brother's illness and death. What struck me most, however, was that this woman treated the story of my brother as if it were mine to tell. As if, in fact, it had happened to me, too, and in a unique way. This was novel. Usually people asked me how my parents had gotten through it. She was the first to ask about me. Until then, I had not really been a figure in my own life story. </p><p>I began to change that day. Slowly, I started consciously to claim ownership of the events in my own life, events that, I was beginning to understand, had had a profound impact on every aspect of who I was. I began to let myself think that what had happened was not only my brother's famous story, or my parents' overwhelming tragedy, but my story, my loss, my tragedy, too. Separate. I began to unearth my feelings, long suppressed, about the loss of my only sibling, the older brother I'd adored. I began to see that my brother's illness and death, that my role as the healthy, surviving sibling, wasn't just some bizarre anomaly amid the rest of society's shared normalcy. I realized that I might be part of a group whose largely uncharted experience has had no name, no movement, no language. Sibling loss. </p><p>Our relationships with our brothers and sisters are key to understanding ourselves. Where they end and where we begin is often so seamless, the loss of a sibling can be a crippling blow to our understanding of who we are, and how we function and relate to others. I suspect that this holds true even in cases in which people have distant or troubled relationships with their brothers and sisters. "Closeness" is not, as we often presume, a prerequisite for connection, and the story of "intimate" relationships is not always a happy one. I've come to think of siblings as an actor might think of a backstory -- the imagined background of a character he's going to play. Those of us in the audience may never get a glimmer of a character's imagined history, but it's there all the same, informing that character's identity, behavior, and choices. Those of us who have siblings all have a "backstory."</p><p>It is, therefore, all the more perplexing to me that the loss of a sibling has long been considered less significant than other losses. It's only in the last twenty years that it has been recognized as a trauma approaching that of the loss of a parent or child. Still, except for the efforts of a handful of experts -- many of whom have lost a sibling themselves, and have been compelled to do research to answer their own questions -- this idea is not universally accepted. Though an estimated 25 percent of Americans have lost a sibling, sibling loss is overshadowed by the parents' loss of their child. In the case of adult siblings, it is overshadowed by the losses of the surviving spouses and children. </p><p>In greeting card stores across the country I have found, as often as not, bereavement cards for the loss of a parent, child, or pet, but not for that of a sibling. Hallmark, the leading manufacturer of greeting cards in this country since 1920, has always carried bereavement cards addressing the loss of parents, grandparents, and children, but did not start producing a sibling-specific line until the 1980s. When asked about my brother, I have repeatedly been faced with a well-intentioned person shaking his or her head sadly, saying, "That must have been terrible for your parents."</p><p>Why is the loss of a sibling such an overlooked experience? Maybe it has something to do with the pattern of infant and childhood mortality that preceded the availability of antibiotics and modern public health measures. At one time in our not-so-distant history, surviving infancy and childhood was something of a feat. Perhaps losing a sibling was, in those years, so common an event as to have become invisible, a given, and for that reason overlooked. Or perhaps, as some researchers have speculated, siblings are more ...</p>Alison Smith<p>author of <i>Name All the Animals</i></p><p><i>The Empty Room</i> is one of those quietly revolutionary books.

It was a beautiful, sunlit day, the branches of the palms in the Place Mar�chal-Foch moved gently in a breeze coming in off the sea, a snow-white cruise ship lay in the harbor like a great iceberg, and I wandered through the streets feeling carefree and at ease, now and then going into one of the dark, tunnel-like entrances of buildings to read the names of their unknown inhabitants on the metal letter boxes with a certain rapt attention, trying to imagine what it would be like to live in one of these stone citadels, occupied to my life&#x2019;s end solely with the study of time past and passing. But since we can none of us really live entirely withdrawn into ourselves, and must all have some more or less significant design in view, my wishful thinking about a few last years with no duties of any kind soon gave way to a need to fill the present afternoon somehow, and so I found myself, hardly knowing how I came there, in the entrance hall of the Mus�e Fesch, with notebook and pencil and a ticket in my hand.<br><br>Joseph Fesch, as I later read on looking him up in my old Guide Bleu, was the son of the late second marriage of Letizia Bonaparte&#x2019;s mother to a Swiss military officer in Genoese service, and was thus Napoleon&#x2019;s step-uncle. At the beginning of his career in the church he held a minor ecclesiastical position in Ajaccio. After his nephew had appointed him archbishop of Lyon and envoy to the Holy See, however, he became one of the most insatiable art collectors of his day, a time when the market was positively flooded with paintings and artifacts taken from churches, monasteries, and palaces during the French Revolution, bought from �migr�s, and looted in the plundering of Dutch and Italian cities.<br><br>Fesch&#x2019;s aim was no less than to document the entire course of European art history in his private collection. No one knows for certain just how many pictures he actually owned, but the number is thought to be around thirty thousand. Among those that, after his death in 1838, and some devious maneuvers on the part of Joseph Bonaparte as executor of the Cardinal&#x2019;s will, found their way into the museum especially built for them in Ajaccio are a Madonna by Cosimo Tura, Botticelli&#x2019;s Virgin Under a Garland, Pier Francesco Cittadini&#x2019;s Still Life with Turkish Carpet, Spadino&#x2019;s Garden Fruits with Parrot, Titian&#x2019;s Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove, and a number of other wonderful paintings.<br><br>The finest of all, it seemed to me that afternoon, was a picture by Pietro Paolini, who lived and worked in Lucca in the seventeenth century. It shows a woman of perhaps thirty against a deep black background which lightens to a very dark brown only toward the left-hand side of the painting. She has large, melancholy eyes and wears a dress the color of the night, which does not stand out from the surrounding darkness even by suggestion and is thus really invisible, and yet it is present in every fold and drape of its fabric. She wears a string of pearls around her neck. Her right arm protectively embraces her small daughter, who stands in front of her turning sideways, toward the edge of the picture, but with her grave face, upon which the tears have only just dried, turned toward the observer in a kind of silent challenge. The little girl wears a brick-red dress, and the soldier doll hardly three inches high which she is holding out to us, whether in memory of her father who has gone to war or to ward off the evil eye we may be casting on her, also wears red. I stood in front of this double portrait for a long time, seeing in it, as I thought at the time, an annulment of all the unfathomable misfortune of life.<br><br>Before leaving the museum I went down to the basement, where there is a collection of Napoleonic mementos and devotional items on display. It includes objects adorned with the head and initials of Napoleon&#x2014;letter openers, seals, penknives, and boxes for tobacco and snuff&#x2014;miniatures of the entire clan and most of their descendants, silhouettes and biscuit medallions, an ostrich egg painted with an Egyptian scene, brightly colored fa�ence plates, porcelain cups, plaster busts, alabaster figures, a bronze of Bonaparte mounted on a dromedary, and also, beneath a glass dome almost as tall as a man, a moth-eaten uniform tunic cut like a tailcoat, edged with red braid and bearing twelve brass buttons: l&#x2019;habit d&#x2019;un colonel des Chasseurs de la Garde, que porta Napol�on Ier (The uniform of a colonel in the Chasseurs de la Garde, worn by Napoleon I).<br><br>There are also many statuettes of the Emperor carved from soapstone and ivory and showing him in familiar poses, the tallest about ten centimeters high and each of the others smaller than the last until the smallest seems almost nothing but a white speck, perhaps representing the vanishing point of human history. One of these diminutive figures depicts Napoleon after his abdication sur le rocher de l&#x2019;�le de Sainte-H�l�ne (on the rock of the island of St. Helena). Scarcely larger than a pea, he sits in cloak and three-cornered hat astride a tiny chair set on a fragment of tuff which really does come from his place of exile, and he is gazing out into the distance with furrowed brow. He cannot have felt at ease there in the middle of the bleak Atlantic, and he must have missed the excitement of his past life, particularly as it seems that he could not really depend even on the few faithful souls who still surrounded him in his isolation.<br><br>Or so, at least, we might conclude from an article in Corse-Matin published on the day of my visit to the Mus�e Fesch, in which a certain Professor Ren� Maury claimed that a study of several hairs from the Emperor&#x2019;s head undertaken in the FBI laboratories established beyond any doubt que Napol�on a lentement �t� empoisonn� � l&#x2019;arsenic � Sainte-H�l�ne, entre 1817 et 1821, par l&#x2019;un de ses compagnons d&#x2019;exil, le comte de Montholon, sur l&#x2019;instigation de sa femme Albine qui �tait devenue la ma�tresse de l&#x2019;empereur et s&#x2019;est trouv�e enceinte de lui. (&#x201c;that Napoleon was slowly poisoned with arsenic on St. Helena, between 1817 and 1821, by one of his companions in exile, the comte de Montholon, at the urging of his wife, Albine, who had become the Emperor&#x2019;s mistress and was pregnant by him.&#x201d;) I do not really know what we should think of such stories. The Napoleonic myth has, after all, given rise to the most astonishing tales, always said to be based on incontrovertible fact. Kafka, for instance, tells us that on November 11, 1911, he attended a conf�rence in the Rudolfinum on the subject of La L�gende de Napol�on, at which one Richepin, a sturdy man of fifty with a fine figure, his hair arranged in stiff whorls in the Daudet style and at the same time lying close to his scalp, said among other things that in the past Napoleon&#x2019;s tomb used to be opened once a year so that old soldiers filing past could set eyes on their embalmed Emperor. But later the custom of the annual opening of the tomb was discontinued, because his face was becoming rather green and bloated. Richepin himself as a child, however, says Kafka, had seen the dead Emperor in the arms of his great-uncle, who had served in Africa and for whom the commandant had the tomb specially opened. Moreover, Kafka&#x2019;s diary entry continues, the conf�rence concluded with the speaker swearing that even in a thousand years&#x2019; time every mote of the dust of his own corpse, should it have consciousness, would still be ready to follow the call of Napoleon.<br><br>After I had left the Mus�e Fesch I sat for a while on a stone bench in the Place Letizia, which is really just a small garden set among tall buildings and containing some trees, with eucalyptus and oleanders, fan palms, laurels, and myrtles forming an oasis in the middle of the town. This garden is separated from the street by iron railings, and the whitewashed fa�ade of the Casa Bonaparte stands on the other side of the road. The flag of the Republic hung over the gateway through which a more or less steady stream of visitors was going in and coming out: Dutch and Germans, Belgians and French, Austrians and Italians, and once a whole group of elderly Japanese of very distinguished appearance. Most of them had left, and the afternoon was already drawing to an end, when I finally entered the building. The dimly lit entrance hall was deserted, and there seemed to be no one at the ticket desk either. Only when I was right in front of the counter, and was just putting out my hand to one of the picture postcards displayed there, did I see a young woman sitting, or I could almost have said lying behind it, in a black leather office armchair tipped backward.<br><br>I actually had to look down at her over the edge of the counter, and this act of looking down at the cashier of the Casa Bonaparte, who was probably only tired from much standing and perhaps had just dozed off, was one of those moments strangely experienced in slow motion that are sometimes remembered years later. When the cashier rose, she proved to be a lady of very stately proportions. You could imagine her on an operatic stage, exhausted by the drama of her life, singing &#x201c;Lasciate mi morire&#x201d; or some such closing aria. Far more striking, however, than her divalike figure, and something that became clear only at second glance but was all the more startling for that, was her resemblance to the French emperor in whose birthplace she acted as doorkeeper.<br><br>She h...</p><h2>Haiku, Vol. 1: Eastern Culture</h2><p>Poetry with Eastern cultural influence.</p><p></p><h2>Hot Springs and Hot Pools of the Northwest: Jayson Loam's Original Guide (Hot Springs &amp; Hot Pools of the Northwest: Jayson Loam's)</h2><p>Totally revised, updated and enlarged edition of the definitive hot springs guide to Alaska, Canada, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Montana, and all states in the mid-west and east where there are springs.

The appearance of flowers after a cold winter season signals the promise of warm summer days to come. Many of the modern celebrations of May are rooted in ancient pagan traditions that honored the earth and the forces that renewed life. In many pre-Christian European regions, Nature was perceived as a goddess and from this ancient concept evolved the modern ?Mother Nature? personification. </p><p>May Day celebrations are a time to acknowledge the return of growth and the end of decline within the cycle of life. The rites of May are rooted in ancient fertility festivals that can be traced back to the Great Mother festivals of the Hellenistic period of Greco-Roman religion. The Romans inherited the celebration of May from earlier Latin tribes such as the Sabines. The ancient Roman festival of Floralia is one of the celebrations of this nature. This festival culminated on May 1 with offerings of flowers and garlands to the Roman goddesses Flora and Maia, for whom the month of May is named. Wreaths mounted on a pole, which was adorned with a flowered garland, were carried in street processions in honor of the goddess Maia.</p><p>With the expansion of the Roman Empire into Gaul and the British Isles, the festivals of May were introduced into Celtic religion. Various aspects of May celebrations such as the blessing of holy wells are traceable to the ancient Roman festival of Fontinalia, which focused upon offerings to spirits that revived wells and streams. Even the Maypole itself is derived from archaic Roman religion. In the Dictionary of Faiths &amp; Folklore by W. C. Hazlitt (London: Bracken Books, 1995), the author states that in ancient Briton it was the custom to erect Maypoles adorned with flowers in honor of the Roman goddess Flora. </p><p>The Maypole is traditionally a tall pole garlanded with greenery or flowers and often hung with ribbons that are woven into complex patterns by a group of dancers. Such performances are the echoes of ancient dances around a living tree in spring rites designed to ensure fertility. Tradition varies as to the type of wood used for the maypole. In some accounts the traditional wood is ash or birch, and in others it is cypress or elm. The Maypole concept can be traced to a figure known as a herms (or hermai) that was placed at the crossroads throughout the Roman Empire. </p><p>A herms is a pillar-like figure sporting the upper torso of a god or spirit. The herms was a symbol of fertility and it was often embellished by an erect penis protruding from the pillar. The earliest herms were simply wooden columns upon which a ritual mask was hung. In time, to reduce replacement costs, the Romans began making the herms from stone instead of wood. In May, the herms was adorned with flowers andgreenery, and sacred offerings were placed before it. This and other practices of ancient Italian paganism were carried by the Romans throughout most of continental Europe and into the British Isles. For further information on this topic the reader is referred to Dionysos: Archetype Image of Indestructible Life by Carl Kerenyi (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976, pp. 380?381). </p><p>In 1724 the noted occultist Dr. William Stuckely, in his work titled the Itinerarium, describes a Maypole near Horn Castle, Lincolnshire, that reportedly stood on the site of a former Roman herms (a wood or stone carving of the upper torso of a body emerging from a pillar). The author records that boys ?annually keep up the festival of the Floralia on May Day,? and carried white willow wands covered with cowslips. Stuckely goes on to say that these wands are derived from the thyrsus wands once carried in the ancient Roman Bacchanal rites. For further information on this, I refer the reader to Hazlitt?s Dictionary of Faiths &amp; Folklore (pp. 402?406). <br>May festivals commonly incorporate elements of pre-Christian worship related to agricultural themes. In ancient times a young male was chosen to symbolize the spirit of the plant kingdom. Known by such names as Jack-in-the-Green, Green George, and the Green Man, he walked in a procession through the villages symbolizing his return as spring moves toward summer. </p><p>Typically a pretty young woman bearing the title ?Queen of the May? led the procession. She was accompanied by a young man selected as the May King, typically symbolized by Jack-in-the-Green. The woman and man, also known as the May Bride and Bridegroom, carried flowers and other symbols of fertility related to agriculture. </p><p>The connection of the tree to May celebrations is quite ancient and is rooted in archaic tree worship throughout Europe. The belief that the gods dwelled within trees was widespread. Later this tenet diminished into a belief that the spirit of vegetation resided in certain types of trees, such as the oak, ash, and hawthorn. In many parts of Europe young people would gather branches and carry them back to their villages on May 1 morning, suspending them in the village square from a tall pole. Bringing newly budding branches into the village was believed to renew life for everyone. Dances were performed around this ?Maypole? to ensure that everyone was connected or woven into the renewing forces of Nature. </p><p>The garland of flowers, associated with May rituals, is a symbol of the inner connections between all things, symbolic of that which binds and connects. Garlands are typically made from plants and flowers that symbolize the season or event for which the garland is hung as a marker or indicator. In ancient Greek and Roman art many goddesses carry garlands, particularly Flora, a flower goddess associated with May. The Maypole is often decorated with a garland as a symbol of fertility, in anticipation of the coming summer and harvest season. </p><p>Among the Celtic people the celebration of May was called Beltane, meaning ?bright fire,? due to the bonfires associated with the ancient rites of this season. This festival occasion was designed as a celebration of the return of life and fertility to a world that has passed through the winter season. It is the third of the four great Celtic fire festivals of the year: Beltane, Imbolc, Lughnasahd, and Samhain. Beltane was traditionally celebrated at the end of April. Many modern Wicca Traditions celebrate Beltane on May 1 or May Eve. Along with its counterpart of Samhain, Beltane divided the Celtic year into its two primary seasons, winter and summer. Beltane marked the beginning of summer?s half and the pastoral growing season. </p><p>Continental Celts worshipped a god known as Belenus. The root word ?Bel? means bright, whether associated with fire or with a light such as the sun. As noted earlier, the word ?Beltane? literally means ?bright fire? and refers to bonfires (known as ?need-fire?) lit during this season. Bel-tane may or may not be derived from the worship of the Celtic deity Belenus (MacKillop, James. Dictionary of Celtic Mythology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 35). In ancient times Beltane heralded the approach of summer and the promise of fullness. Herds of cattle were ritually driven between two bonfires as an act of purification and protection. This was believed to ensure their safety and fertility throughout the remainder of the year. The fires celebrated the warmth of the sun, and its power to return life and fruitfulness to the soil. Ashes from the sacred bonfires lit at Beltane were scattered over the fields to ensure fertility. An old Welsh custom was to take some ash home for protection, or to put ashes in one?s shoe to guard against misfortune. </p><p>Many modern Wiccans/Witches believe that the Beltane festival was held in honor of the god Bel. In some modern traditions he is also known as Beli, Balar, Balor, or Belenus. Authors Janet and Stewart Farrar point out that some people have suggested that Bel is the Brythonic Celt equivalent of the god Cernunnos. (Farrar, Janet &amp; Stewart. Eight Sabbats for Witches. London: Robert Hale, 1981, pp. 80?81). In modern Wicca/Witchcraft, Beltane marks the appearance of the Horned One, who is the rebirth of the solar God slain during the Wheel of the Year. He then becomes consort to the Goddess, impregnating Her with his seed, and thereby ensuring his own rebirth once again. In the evolution of god images, he became the Harvest Lord of agrarian society. In this regard the god is associated with the Green Man, a popular image connecting the god to the ever-returning cycle of foliage and flowering. </p><p>Southern European traditions, such as those of old Italy, celebrate the ripeness of May by tying ribbons and lemons around flowering branches. Potted trees, anointed male and female, are brought into a plaza and married in a mock ceremony. As with all things Italian, food is in abundance and traditional meals are served. Groups of people join together in street processions led by a young woman who carries a garlanded branch decorated with ribbons, fresh fruits, and lemons. </p><p>One very interesting observance of May is held in the mountainous region near Cocullo, just east of Rome. Here the inhabitants gather in a snake festival. The snakes are carried into the plaza in terracotta jugs filled with grain. The snakes are then handled by keepers and carried around their shoulders. Observers are coaxed into holding the snakes and the festival becomes very exciting. The origin of this festival is traceable to the ancient rites of an Italic people known as the Marsi. They worshipped a snake goddess known as Angizia. In time legends aroseassociating her with Circe, an ancient Greek sorceress. Today the goddess Angizia has been replaced by Saint Domenico, who is said to protect people from poisonous snakes. Saint Domenico was previously associated with a miracle connected to the growth of fava beans. Both snakes and fava beans are intimately connected in Italic paganism to themes of emergence from the Underworld. <br>The snake was first associated with the month of May as a fertility symbol. To the ancients, the snake penetrated the earth, an act suggestive of sexual intercourse. Because the earth was a fertile region, the snake was believed to possess its inner secrets by disappearing into the depths below. In occult lore the snake represents the inner knowledge of creation and is considered a guardian of the waters of life. Due to their ability to shed their skin, snakes symbolize rebirth and eternal life, one of the reasons why snakes appear on the caduceus symbol worn by medical professionals. <br></p>OLD MAY CUSTOMS <br><p>In his Dictionary of Faiths &amp; Folklore, author W. C. Hazlitt recounts a custom practiced among the ancient Romans where young boys ?go out Maying? on April 30 to collect branches for celebrating the first of May. A similar custom is still observed today among the Cornish, who decorate their doorways on the first of May with green boughs of sycamore and hawthorn. In Huntingdonshire, people gather sticks for fuel on May Day, an act perhaps related to the Druidic custom of lighting fires on May Day atop the Crugall (Druid?s Mound). In northern England it was long the custom to rise at midnight and gather branches in the neighboring woods, adorning them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. At sunrise the gatherers would return home and decorate their doors and windows. In Ireland it was once the custom to fasten a green bough against the home on the first of May to ensure an abundance of milk in the coming summer. Ancient Druids were said to have herded cattle through an open fire on this day in a belief that such an act would keep the cattle from disease all year. </p><p>A curious custom of the past called ?May Birching? seems to have evolved from the ancient symbolism of trees. On May Eve, participants called ?May Birchers? went about various neighborhoods affixing branches or sprigs to the doors of selected houses. The symbolism of what they left there was meant to indicate their sentiments regarding those who dwelled in the respective homes. To leave gorse (in bloom) meant that the woman of the house had a bad reputation. This may be related to an old saying in Northamptonshire: ?When gorse is out of bloom, kissing is out of season.? The branch of any nut-bearing tree was a sign of open promiscuity. The flowering branch of a hawthorn was a compliment, indicating that the occupants were well liked in the community. However, any other type of thorn indicated that the inhabitants were scorned. The presence of a rowan meant that the people were well loved. To leave briar was an indication that the people were untrustworthy. </p><p>Another May custom connected to the theme of gathering is the collection of dew in the early morning on May 1. Among the ancient Romans the dew was sacred to the goddess Diana, who was also known as ?The Dewy One.? It was believed that the moon left the morning dew during the night. In Italian Witchcraft dew is collected from several sacred plants and is then used as a type of holy water. This holy dew-water of May is believed to bestow good fortune throughout the year. In some parts of Britain young country girls go out just before sunrise on May Day and collect dew from the plants. The dew is then applied to their faces in the belief that it will keep their complexions beautiful and will remove blemishes. <br></p>MAY GARLANDS <br>The May garland is an emblem of summer and is decorated with bright ribbons, fresh leaves, and every type of flower available at the season. Traditionally the May doll is hung suspended inside the hoop of the garland. Garlands have long been associated with May and their use in May celebrations is traceable to the ancient Roman festival of Flora. In the British Isles, peeled willow wands often sport May garlands. The May staves are often adorned with posies or wreaths of cowslips. At Horncastle in Lincolnshire it was once the custom to carry adorned wands in a procession culminating in their placement on a hill where an ancient Roman temple once stood. The flowers of the foxglove plant are traditionally set in place on the May garland in honor of the fairies. (See pp. 143?144 for directions for constructing a May garland.) <br>THE Maypole <br><p>The Maypole is the symbol of the spirit of vegetation returning and renewing its life with the approach of summer. Traditionally the Maypole was topped with a wreath that symbolized the fertile power of Nature. Ribbons, an ancient talisman of protection dating back to archaic Roman religion, were attached to the pole to ensure the safety of the newborn season. Celebrants encircled the pole and danced in a symbolic weaving of human life with the life of Nature itself. <br>The Maypole appears to have evolved from archaic Roman religion where it began as an object known as a herms, as noted earlier in this chapter. However, some commentators believe that the Maypole originates from the Phrygian pine tree of Attis carried in the sacred processions related to the temple of Cybele. In ancient Roman religion this was connected with the festival known as Hilaria, a joyful rite of merriment that included dancing around a pole. With the spread of Roman influence into northern Europe these elements of Italic paganism were absorbed into Celtic and Germanic religion. </p><p>The traditional Maypole dance is both a circular and a spiral dance. It involves alternation of male and female dancers who move in and out from the center to ...</p></p><h2>Recapitulation</h2><p>The moving sequel to the bestselling <b>Big Rock Candy Mountain</b>.<p>Bruce Mason returns to Salt Lake City not for his aunt's funeral, but to encounter after forty-five years the place he fled in bitterness.

But this time I&#x2019;m actually going. </i><br><br>My name&#x2019;s Bobby Dollar, sometimes known as Doloriel, and of course, Hell isn&#x2019;t a great place for someone like me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m an angel. They don&#x2019;t like my kind down there, not even the slightly fallen variety. But they have my girlfriend, who happens to be a beautiful demon named Casimira, Countess of Cold Hands. Why does an angel have a demon girlfriend? Well, certainly not because it helps my career.<br><br>She&#x2019;s being held hostage by one of the nastiest, most powerful demons in all of the netherworld&#x2014;Eligor, Grand Duke of Hell. He already hates me, and he&#x2019;d like nothing better than to get his hands on me and rip my immortal soul right out of my borrowed but oh-so-mortal body.<br><br>But wait, it gets better! Not only do I have to sneak into Hell, make my way across thousands of miles of terror and suffering to reach Pan- demonium, capital of the fiery depths, but then I have to steal Caz right out from under Eligor&#x2019;s burning eyes and smuggle her out again, past demon soldiers, hellhounds, and all the murderous creatures imprisoned there for eternity. And even if I somehow manage to escape Hell, I&#x2019;m also being stalked by an undead psychopath named Smyler who&#x2019;s been following me for weeks. Oh, and did I mention that he can&#x2019;t be killed?<br><br>So if I somehow survive Hell, elude the Grand Duke and all his hideous minions and make it back to the real world, I&#x2019;ll still be the most hunted soul in Creation. But at least I&#x2019;ll have Caz. Gotta have something to look forward to, right?<br><br>So just pour me that damn drink, will you?

I have more of those than most people (a couple a week, on average) but I&#x2019;d never had one quite like this before. See, I was just about to walk into Hell. Voluntarily.</p><p>My name is Bobby Dollar, or sometimes Doloriel, depending on the company I&#x2019;m keeping. I&#x2019;d arrived at this ugly spot by elevator&#x2014;a long, long ride down that I may or may not tell you about at some point. I was also wearing a body that wasn&#x2019;t my own, and all my information about the place came from a rogue guardian angel whispering in my mind while I was sleeping. Not that I had learned much useful stuff from her. In fact, most of it could be summed up with the simple phrase, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t even guess how bad this is going to be.&#x201d;</p><p>So there I stood, just outside Hell, at the foot of the Neronian Bridge, a featureless, flat span of stone that stretched over a chasm so deep that, if we had been on ordinary old Earth, the hole would probably have gone all the way through the planet and out of the other side. But Hell isn&#x2019;t on ordinary Earth and this pit wasn&#x2019;t bottomless&#x2014;oh, no. See, at the bottom, impossible miles and miles below me in the darkness, the really bad shit was going on. I could tell that because of the faint sounds of screaming. I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering how hard those folks had to be screaming to be heard that far. Also, what exactly was being done to them to make them scream like that? Already I was asking questions with answers I didn&#x2019;t want to know.</p><p>Just in case all this isn&#x2019;t weird enough for you, here&#x2019;s another interesting fact: I&#x2019;m an angel. So not only was I headed to the worst possible place anyone could ever go, I was doing it as a spy and an enemy. Oh, and I was going there to steal something from one of the cruelest, most powerful demons that ever existed, Eligor the Horseman, Grand Duke of Hell.</p><p>What was I trying to steal from Eligor? My girlfriend, Caz. She&#x2019;s also a demon and she belongs to him.</p><p>Oh, and when I said I was an angel, I didn&#x2019;t mean the avenging kind with wings and the Lord&#x2019;s Righteous Fire to wield against my enemies. No, I&#x2019;m the kind who lives on Earth, pretends to be human most of the time, and advocates on behalf of human souls at judgement. In other words, I&#x2019;m pretty much a public defender. So what I brought to the conflict was just enough information to know I was in serious trouble. Me against a Grand Duke of Hell on his home turf&#x2014;great match-up, huh?</p><p>I was in what was, without question, the biggest enclosed space I&#x2019;d ever seen&#x2014;that anyone had ever seen, probably. All those medieval artists who&#x2019;d pictured the place, even the really inventive ones, had never thought big enough for this. A wall of rugged stone surrounded me, extending straight up beyond sight. It seemed to be ever so slightly curved on either side, as though the vast cavern itself was the casing of a monstrous engine cylinder. Presumably there was another wall in front of me on the far side of the bridge, the piston inside that bigger cylinder and the point of my visit, the endless tower that is Hell. The bridge itself was narrower than my arms could stretch to either side, a walking surface only about a yard and a half wide. That would have been plenty, except for the fact that beneath the narrow span lay nothing but emptiness&#x2014;a pit that extended down farther than I could see or even understand, with just enough flickering hell-light to let me know how very, very far I&#x2019;d be falling if I took a wrong step.</p><p>Trust me. Like any sane being, I would have rather been anywhere else, but as I&#x2019;ll explain later, I&#x2019;d worked hard to get even this far. I had learned how to get here, found an entrance nobody remembered to guard, and I was even wearing a brand-new demon body (because that&#x2019;s the only way I could travel safely in Hell). I might have been an unwanted guest, but I had already paid quite a bit to take this ride.</p><p>As I approached the span I gulped a deep breath made gritty by sulfur smoke and the faint but unmistakable tang of crisping flesh. A stone skittered away from my foot and bounced into the pit. I didn&#x2019;t wait to hear if it made a noise, since there wouldn&#x2019;t have been much point. You can only stall something terrible so long before all the courage just leaks out of you, and I knew that things would only get worse from here. Even if I made it across this whisper-thin span and managed to sneak into Hell, the whole place was jam-packed with creatures that just plain hated angels in general and me in particular.</p><p>The Neronian Bridge dates back to ancient Rome, and it&#x2019;s named after the Emperor Nero, the one who supposedly fiddled while Rome burned. Nero wasn&#x2019;t the worst emperor Rome ever had, but he was pretty much of a horrible bastard anyway, and one of the ways we know this is because he had his own mother murdered. Twice.</p><p>His mother Agrippina was the sister of another, even nastier little bastard you may have heard of&#x2014;Caligula. He married one of his other sisters, but he humped them all. Still, despite all the creepy stuff with her brother, after Caligula was stabbed to death by his own guards Agrippina was rehabilitated and eventually married Caligula&#x2019;s successor, old Emperor Claudius. Somehow she even managed to convince Claudius to put aside his own beloved son and instead make Nero, her son by a previous marriage, his heir. Once Nero was the emperor-designate, she bumped off poor Claudius by feeding him poisoned mushrooms.</p><p>Clearly grateful for his mother&#x2019;s assistance in becoming the most powerful man in the world, Nero promptly turned around and ordered her killed. He first tried to do it with a trick boat that was supposed to break apart so she&#x2019;d drown, but Agrippina was a tough old bitch and made it back to land, so Nero sent some of his guardsmen over to her house to stab her to death with swords.</p><p>Family values, Roman Empire style.</p><p>Nero did a lot of other pretty terrible stuff during the rest of his reign, including burning a buttload of innocent Christians, but that isn&#x2019;t the reason he got his own little highway project in Hell, the bridge I stood in front of now. See, what Nero didn&#x2019;t realize is that his mother&#x2019;s coup in getting Claudius to marry her and raise Nero above his own son was the result of a little bargain she&#x2019;d made with one of Hell&#x2019;s more influential inhabitants, a powerful demon by the name of Ignoculi. Now, Ignoculi and his infernal pals didn&#x2019;t give a (literal) damn about Nero killing his mother&#x2014;in fact, they rather admired it. But they did expect him to live up to the terms of the bargain his mother had made to put Nero on the throne of the Roman Empire, because Hell had big plans for Rome. But Nero refused to play along. To be honest, he probably didn&#x2019;t realize how big an operation Hell really was&#x2014;the Romans had a different religious picture of things, Pluto and the Elysian Fields and all that stuff. It was probably a bit like that movie producer in the Godfather who thought he could tell Don Corleone to fuck off, then woke up to find a horse&#x2019;s head added to the bedroom decor.</p><p>Pissing off Hell is not a good idea. Things went downhill rapidly for young Nero, and within a short period of time he found himself off the throne and on the run. He eventually wound up committing suicide. However, the real surprises were still waiting for him.</p><p>Ignoculi, like most of Hell&#x2019;s executives, was extremely good at bearing a grudge. When Nero arrived in Hell it was to discover a special entrance had been built just for him. Yep, the Neronian Bridge. A thousand demons dressed in the finery of Roman imperial guardsmen were already there, waiting to accompany Nero across it in the splendor to which he had become accustomed in life. The great procession set off in single file across the abyss, drums pounding and trumpets tootling, but when Nero reached the other end his retinue abruptly vanished, leaving only the emperor and the one who was waiting to greet him&#x2014;not Ignoculi himself, but Nero&#x2019;s late mother, Agrippina.</p><p>She must have made a pretty awful sight, crooked and broken and soaking wet from Nero&#x2019;s first attempt on her life, streaming blood from the sword-thrusts that killed her. Nero, suddenly realizing that he was going to receive something less than a hero&#x2019;s welcome, tried to flee back across the bridge, but now Ignoculi himself made an appearance on the bridge, a huge, quivering glob of eyes and teeth that blocked the ex-emperor&#x2019;s retreat like a ton of angry snot.</p><p>&#x201c;Caveat imperator,&#x201d; the demon reportedly said. In Hell, bad puns are considered a particularly ripe form of torture. Then Agrippina grabbed her son in her bloody, mangled fingers and, with strength she&#x2019;d never had in life, dragged him shrieking through the gate to Hell and the less-than-imperial fate prepared for him. And of course, from what I&#x2019;ve heard he&#x2019;s still there, probably down at the bottom with the rest of the screamers.</p><p>After that, the Neronian Bridge was largely forgotten until I got there, just another monument to why you never, never, never get one of hell&#x2019;s high rollers mad at you&#x2014;something that I had already managed, big time. Do you think the universe might have been trying to tell me something?</p><p>I stepped onto the bridge and started walking.</p><p>I had been putting one foot in front of the other for what seemed hours when I noticed that the screams wafting up from below seemed to be growing louder. I hoped that meant I was finally nearing the center of the bridge, but it might just have been that lunch break was over downstairs. I looked down, steadying myself against a dizziness that wasn&#x2019;t just physical but existential. Perspective turned the flames issuing from cracks in the pit walls into shrinking, tightening rings of concentric fire like a burning bull&#x2019;s-eye.</p><p>Leathery wings flapped past my face, startling me badly, and I realized how close to the edge I was standing. I moved back into the middle of the bridge and began walking again, still in the wrong direction by any sane standard. The winged thing fluttered past me again, brushing against my skin, but the light was too faint to make out what it was. I don&#x2019;t think it was a bat, because it was crying.</p><p>Hours and hours later, the smoldering bull&#x2019;s-eye was still more or less right beneath me. When you&#x2019;re crossing a Hell-moat that could be as wide as South Dakota I guess the idea of &#x201c;near the middle&#x201d; is fairly relative, but it sure was depressing.</p><p>But this was all for Caz, I kept reminding myself, for the Countess of Cold Hands, the beautiful, ruined young girl trapped in an immortal body and sentenced to Hell. No, it wasn&#x2019;t even for Caz, it was for what we had together, for the moments of happiness and peace I had felt lying in bed with her while the infernal hordes harrowed the streets of San Judas looking for me. Yes, she was one of those infernal minions herself, and yes she had all but told me that I was turning an incident of straightforward battlefield sex between two enemies into some absurd, juvenile love story . . . but oh my sweet God, she was lovely. Nothing in my angelic life had made me feel like she did. Even more, my time with her had showed me that my existence up to this point had been hollow. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for that, maybe I could have believed it was all demonic glamour&#x2014;that I had simply been seduced, that I&#x2019;d fallen for the oldest trick in the Adversary&#x2019;s book. (There was another reason I didn&#x2019;t think I was simply being played for a chump. It had to do with a silver locket, but I&#x2019;ll tell you more about that later.) Anyway, if what I felt for Caz was just a trick, an illusion, then nothing else mattered, either.</p><p>Love. Tired old jokes aside, a real, powerful love does have one thing in common with Hell itself: it burns everything else out of you.</p><p>Hours in, hypnotized by endless, flickering shadows, it took me far longer than it should have to realize that the spot of darkness on the bridge ahead of me was not simply another shadow or a floating spot in my vision but something real. I slowed, squinting, my dreamy half-life suddenly cracked into pieces. Was it waiting for me? Had Eligor found out I was coming and prepared a welcome for me, something like that horned Babylonian nightmare that I had barely managed to survive back in San Jude? The only thing that had stopped the last one was a precious piece of silver, Caz&#x2019;s locket, but I didn&#x2019;t have anything like that now. My new demon body was naked and I didn&#x2019;t have a gun. I didn&#x2019;t even have a stick.</p><p>As I got closer I saw that the shape wasn&#x2019;t standing erect like a man but was on all fours like an animal. Closer still and I could see that it was crawling away from me, which gave me my first moment of relief since I&#x2019;d stepped onto this bloody bridge. Mama Dollar&#x2019;s baby boy is no fool, though, or at least not in the obvious ways; as I began to catch up to the solitary crawler I slowed down so I could examine it.</p><p>It was manlike but unpleasant to watch, like a blind, clumsy insect. Its hands were clubbed and fingerless, the body distorted, and even by the standards of that miserable place it reflected very little light: it seemed less like a solid thing and more like a smudge on the surface of reality. I was right behind it now, but it seemed unaware of my presence, still crawling like a crippled penitent, drawing itself along as though each movement was miserably difficult. The very slowness of its progress made me wonder how long it had been on the bridge.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want to walk around it, not on that narrow span. Just because it looked slow and stupid didn&#x2019;t mean it wouldn&#x2019;t turn on me. I considered simply jumping over it, but I didn&#x2019;t trust the footing either.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>The sudden noise of my new, raspy demon-voice startled even me, but the crawling thing gave no indication it had heard. I tried again.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to get past you.&#x201d;</p><p>Nothing. If the crawling thing wasn&#x2019;t deaf, it was sure acting like it.</p><p>Frustrated, I finally reached down and yanked on its leg to get its attention, but although the man-shape looked solid, it was as brittle as a dessert meringue. The entire limb broke loose underneath my fingers in flaky shards, leaving nothing below the knee. In horror, I dropped the substantial piece of leg. It broke into pieces, many of which bounced slowly over the edge of the bridge and vanished into darkness. The thing finally stopped crawling long enough to turn toward me, and I caught a glimpse of a gray face with empty hollows for eyes and an equally empty hole of a mouth stretched wide in surprise or horror. Then it tilted to one side as if the loss of the leg had overbalanced it and toppled off the bridge without a sound.</p><p>Shaken, I stepped over the greasy flakes that remained and walked on.</p><p>Whatever the crumbling horror might have been, it was not the only one of its kind. I caught up with the next gray thing before too long, another man-shaped blob creeping toward the still invisible walls of Hell. I tried to poke this one gently enough to get its attention. It seemed as fragile as sea foam, but just the feel of it on my fingertip made me queasy. How could something with no substance hold a shape, let alone crawl for...</p></p><h2>A Surprise for Caroline (Caroline American Girls Collection, 3)</h2><p>Caroline imagined it would be great fun to have two girls staying at her house for the winter.

That idealism, however, is now imperiled by an obsession with the demographic categories of race, sex, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, which supposedly constitute a person&#x2019;s &#x201c;identity.&#x201d; As interest groups defined by identity alone command the comprehensive allegiance of their members, ordinary politics gives way to &#x201c;Identitarian&#x201d; warfare, each group looking for payback and convinced that if it is to rise, another group must fall.<br> <br> In a society governed by &#x201c;social justice,&#x201d; the most coveted status is victimhood, which people will go to absurd lengths to attain. But the real victims in such a regime are blind justice&#x2014;the standard of impartiality that we once took for granted&#x2014;and free speech.

The lifelong monetary problems experienced by his "poor dad" (whose weekly paychecks, while respectable, were never quite sufficient to meet family needs) pounded home the counterpoint communicated by his "rich dad" (that "the poor and the middle class work for money," but "the rich have money work for them").

Although Kiyosaki can take a frustratingly long time to make his points, his book nonetheless compellingly advocates for the type of "financial literacy" that's never taught in schools. Based on the principle that income-generating assets always provide healthier bottom-line results than even the best of traditional jobs, it explains how those assets might be acquired so that the jobs can eventually be shed. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Robert Kiyosaki has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of people around the world think about money. With perspectives that often contradict conventional wisdom, Robert has earned a reputation for straight talk, irreverence and courage.

In the Spanish Basque country itself, food and eating are the center of everyday life and the focus of endless conversation. Basque women lovingly pass on their cooking techniques to daughters and granddaughters, and Basque men, who belong to traditional cooking clubs called txokos, themselves enjoy lingering over stove and table.</p><p>Few people have stayed in one place as long as the Basque people have stayed in Basque Country, which spreads from northern Spain across the Pyrenees into France and stretches out to the sea. Basque Country has remained intact from the time of cave paintings to today. The Basque language is a language unlike any other; even Basque DNA is different from any other European DNA. So it should come as no surprise that the food of Basque Country, while similar to what is found in other parts of Spain and France, is distinct as to its place and people of origin. Restaurant owner and chef Teresa Barrenechea invites one and all to come sit at the Basque table and learn while enjoying.<p> Though <i>nueva cocina</i> has invaded Basque cooking, Barrenechea has intentionally left it aside for another book. She cleaves to tradition in <i>The Basque Table</i>, to the <i>pinchos</i> (like <i>tapas</i>), first courses, and main courses that make up the traditional meal served in Basque homes. It is a deceptively simple cuisine, something of a tightrope act, that demands of any cook the ability to select the best possible ingredients. When, in a dish like <i>Chuletitas de Cordero</i> (grilled lamb chops), you are only working with the chops, olive oil, garlic, flat-leaf parsley, and salt, there's no place to hide. And yet, when everything is exemplary and the chops come off the grill at the perfect moment, the effect in the mouth and in the heart and soul of any diner will defy description. A tough kind of simple, in other words.</p><p> A fierce pride shows in Barrenechea's recipe descriptions and food notes. She holds herself to the highest cultural standard. What she aims for and achieves is a replication in print, with an American kitchen in mind, of exactly how a certain dish should taste to the Basque palate. </p><p> So take heart in dishes like sweetbreads with garlic and parsley, crayfish in hot sauce, mushrooms with scrambled eggs, white bean stew, roasted fresh ham, chicken Basque style, fresh cod with red and black sauces, grilled prawns, and trout Navarra-style. You may be cooking at home, but you'll be sitting and eating at a Basque table. And there's no other table quite like it. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Its a delight to encounter a book that revels in the honest flavors of farm, garden, and sea. As I sit back and read Teresa Barrenecheas book, there unfolds a cuisine at once pure, simple, and joyful. Teresa is a natural cook who helps us understand a diverse and sophisticated culinary tradition and a rich and fascinating culture. -James Peterson <p>The Passion of Teresa Barrenechea for her beloved home countrys cooking is evident on every page of this masterful examination of a long-neglected, wholly wonderful cuisine. -John Mariani </p><p>In Europe, the Basques are known for their creativity in the kitchen and their long-enduring culinary heritage. In Spain's Basque Country itself, food and eating are the center of everyday life and the focus of endless conversation. Basque women lovingly pass on their cooking techniques to daughters and granddaughters, and Basque men, who belong to traditional cooking clubs called txokos, themselves enjoy lingering over stove and table. </p><p>In recent years, many fine cookbooks have celebrated Europe's best regional cooking, from Tuscan and Sicilian to Burgundian and Provenal. In The Basque Table, Teresa Barrenechea reveals the secrets of what until now has been an undiscovered gem among the Continent's cuisines. For starters, there are plates full of pinchos, the Basque version of tapas. Among main courses, there is a wealth of light and healthy fish and shellfish fare, a Basque specialty, including such classics as Salt Cod Pil Pil and Baked Salmon with Vinaigrette. Rustic and hearty meat dishes like Grilled Filet Mignon with Roasted Red Peppers or Lamb in Rosemary Sauce, savory poultry dishes like Chicken Basque-Style, and soups, stews, salads, and sides fill out the feast. Alongside the more than 130 recipes for sophisticated yet down to earth fare, Barrenechea relates a bounty of tales about the Basque people and their passion for cooking and eating with family and friends. She serves up a warmhearted and inspiring invitation, for fans of ethnic cooking and European cooking alike, to discover a tasty new cuisine.</p></p><h2>Simple Isn&#39;t Easy: How to Find Your Personal Style and Look Fantastic Every Day!</h2><p>A humorous and practical guide offers tips on how to clean out the closet, find personal &#34;signature styles&#34; that make stylish dressing simple and effective, and save money while clothes shopping.

With her husband, Sam, on a trip to Russia (planned long before their recent wedding), and Hazel Marie vacationing in Mexico, Abbotsville, North Carolina's redoubtable doyenne decides not to wait for the police to solve the case. Instead, she enlists Little Lloyd, disreputable Etta Mae Wiggins, and drunken PI Frank Tuttle in a scheme to drive down to Florida and recover the stolen jewels herself. If most of these names don't mean anything to you, it's because you aren't yet one of the Miss Julia series' many readers.

Entire nations have risen, and savage wars have been fought--all since the dead of Earth found themselves resurrected in their magnificent new homeworld.

Hot on his heels are Samuel Clemens, King John of England, and Cyrano de Bergerac.

For death on Riverworld has become chillingly final . . .</p><p><i>The Dark Design</i> is the third book in the epic Riverworld saga, in which almost all of humanity has been resurrected on a strange planet along the shores of a river 22 million miles long. But why have humans been given another chance at life, and who is behind it all? That's what Sir Richard Francis Burton and Sam Clemens set out to discover in two earlier novels, one by riding the "suicide express" (if you die on Riverworld, you're resurrected again at a random point along the river) and the other steaming on the greatest riverboat ever seen. Now Milton Firebrass, Clemens's former enemy and now his No. 1 lieutenant, is planning to use the dwindling iron supply on the Riverworld to create a great airship, which can fly to the North Polar Sea far more quickly than any boat can travel. There he hopes to learn the secret of the mysterious tower thought to house the beings who created this planet.<p> Jill Gulbirra does not care as much about the mission as she wants the chance to captain the great airship, which in all likelihood will be the last airship ever constructed by humankind. But in landing the coveted role, she faces stiff competition--especially from the greatest swordsman of all time, Cyrano de Bergerac, who turns out to be a natural pilot. But even if Jill can win the command of the airship and even if the ship can reach the river's headwaters, there is no guarantee it can get through the mountain wall that surrounds the tower. And it's likely that one or more agents of the Ethicals--the creators of Riverworld--are on board the airship, plotting its downfall. Worse still, somewhere along the way the airship is sure to encounter the <i>Rex Grandissimus</i>, the steamboat stolen by Sam's archnemesis, King John Lackland. <i>--Craig E.

His sexual appetite and prowess were matched only by his violence, both on the battlefield and in the bedroom. A charismatic leader, exalted as "a man after God's own heart," he was also capable of deep cunning, deceit, and betrayal. Now, in King David: The Real Life of the Man Who Ruled Israel, bestselling author Jonathan Kirsch reveals this commanding individual in all his glory and fallibility. <br><br>In a taut, dramatic narrative, Kirsch brings new depth and psychological complexity to the familiar events of David's life--his slaying of the giant Goliath and his swift challenge to the weak rule of Saul, the first Jewish king; his tragic relationship with Saul's son Jonathan, David's cherished friend (and possibly lover); his celebrated reign in Jerusalem, where his dynasty would hold sway for generations. Yet for all his greatness, David was also a man in thrall to his passions--a voracious lover who secured the favors of his beautiful mistress Bathsheba by secretly arranging the death of her innocent husband; a merciless warrior who triumphed through cruelty; a troubled father who failed to protect his daughter from rape and whose beloved son Absalom rose against him in armed insurrection. <br><br>Weaving together biblical texts with centuries of interpretation and commentary, Jonathan Kirsch brings King David to life in these pages with extraordinary freshness, intimacy, and vividness of detail. At the center of this inspiring narrative stands a hero of flesh and blood--not the cartoon giant-slayer of sermons and Sunday school stories or the immaculate ruler of legend and art but a magnetic, disturbingly familiar man--a man as vibrant and compelling today as he has been for millennia.</p><p>The difficulty of bringing into perspective figures that are larger than life is well known to Jonathan Kirsch, the author of a life of Moses and of the provocative biblical study <i>The Harlot by the Side of the Road</i>. In this well-researched narrative he attempts the same for King David, arguably the most important figure in the entire Jewish Bible. By searching for the real King David, Kirsch does not claim to bring new information to this study. He is more journalist than biblical scholar, and clearly acknowledges when he is speculating (as, for example, in his reconstruction of the scene when David first glimpses the beautiful Bathsheba). Rather, he wants to remind his readers that David is not myth but flesh and blood and is, astonishingly, presented this way in the biblical texts themselves. He is real, human, both heroic and flawed.<p> Following much of modern scholarship in calling the Bible "a patchwork of ancient texts that were composed and compiled by countless authors and editors," this study is clearly not going to appeal to most fundamentalist readers. Neither is it intended for scholars. It should, however, satisfy many readers who wish to explore more deeply the fascinating and pivotal life of a very real man, a charismatic leader who, as one historian puts it, "played exquisitely, fought heroically, and loved titanically." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Commentary on the Holy Bible</h2><p>Perhaps the only true rival to Matthew Henry!

But even their soothsayers can only hint at the changes to come, for the battle of the soul of Africa has begun. From the east comes a new religion, Islam, and from the West, the slave trade. <p> <b>Segu</b> follows the life of Dousika Traore, the king&#x2019;s most trusted advisor, and his four sons, whose fates embody the forces tearing at the fabric of the nation.

Classical Greece's view of sex as a means of obtaining individual pleasure faced increasing challenge in Hellenistic times. The love of boys now assumed more muted tones, often finding itself at odds with the highly valued ideals of marital fidelity and virginity. The Stoic approach, as Foucault demonstrates in a nuanced discussion, both resembled and differed from the asceticism of Christianity. This volume, perhaps the last that will appear of the author's posthumous History of Sexuality ( LJ 10/15/78; 12/1/85) manifests Foucault's powerful analytic ability. Though at times it draws very broad conclusions from the discussion of relatively few texts, it is still highly recommended.

McDonald, 1932-1935</h2><p><p>The private diary of James G. McDonald (1886&#x2013;1964) offers a unique and hitherto unknown source on the early history of the Nazi regime and the Roosevelt administration&#x2019;s reactions to Nazi persecution of German Jews. Considered for the post of U.S. ambassador to Germany at the start of FDR&#x2019;s presidency, McDonald traveled to Germany in 1932 and met with Hitler soon after the Nazis came to power. Fearing Nazi intentions to remove or destroy Jews in Germany, in 1933 he became League of Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and sought aid from the international community to resettle outside the Reich Jews and others persecuted there. In late 1935 he resigned in protest at the lack of support for his work.</p><p>This is the eagerly awaited first of a projected three-volume work that will significantly revise the ways that scholars and the world view the antecedents of the Holocaust, the Shoah itself, and its aftermath.</p></p><p><b>Sara J.

Yet McDonald's diaries are much more than historic; they are filled with candor and eloquence as well as insight and emotion." <p><b>Daniel C. Kurtzer, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Egypt</b><br> "Publication of James McDonald's diaries is a much-anticipated event. The diaries enhance our understanding of the life and work of one of the last century's most dedicated and interesting public servants. They show what one man--altruistic, high-minded, and intent on doing what is right--can achieve." </p><p><b>Gerhard L. Weinberg, William Rand Kenan, Jr., Professor of History Emeritus, University of North Carolina</b><br> "McDonald's diaries shed important new light on efforts to assist Jews fleeing Germany in the years 1933-1935 from the perspective of an individual deeply involved in those efforts--and one who did not revise whatever he wrote at the time. . . .

McDonald had unparalleled access to decision makers and critics, persecutors and victims, and both German and American political leaders.

Ted lives in Austin with his wife, Lee Ann, and their four children.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p>It all started one day earlier with a single silenced bullet out of nowhere.</p> <p>Thomas Hunter was walking down the same dimly lit alley he always took on his way home after locking up the small Java Hut on Colfax and Ninth, when a smack! punctuated the hum of distant traffic. Red brick dribbled from a one-inch hole two feet away from his face. He stopped midstride. </p> <p>Smack!</p> <p>This time he saw the bullet plow into the brick. This time he felt a sting on his cheek as tiny bits of shattered brick burst from the impact. This time every muscle in his body ceased. </p> <p>Someone had just shot at him!</p> <p>Was shooting at him. </p> <p>Tom recoiled to a crouch and instinctively spread his arms. He couldn't seem to tear his eyes off those two holes in the brick, dead ahead. They had to be some mistake. Figments of his overactive imagination. His aspirations to write novels had finally ruptured the line between fantasy and reality with these two empty eye sockets staring at him from the red brick.</p> <p>"Thomas Hunter!" </p> <p>That wasn't his imagination, was it? No, that was his name, and it was echoing down the alley. A third bullet crashed into the brick wall.</p> <p>He bolted to his left, still crouching. One long step, drop the right shoulder, roll. Again the air split above his head. This bullet clanged into a steel ladder and rang down the alley.</p> <p>Tom came to his feet and chased the sound in a full sprint, pushed by instinct as much as by terror. He'd been here before, in the back alleys of Manila. He'd been a teenager then, and the Filipino gangs were armed with knives and machetes rather than guns, but at the moment, tearing down the alley behind Ninth and Colfax, Tom's mind wasn't drawing any distinction.</p> <p>"You're a dead man!" the voice yelled. </p> <p>Now he knew who they were. They were from New York.</p> <p>This alley led to another thirty yards ahead, on his left. A mere shadow in the dim light, but he knew the cutaway. </p> <p>Two more bullets whipped by, one so close he could feel its wind on his left ear. Feet pounded the concrete behind him. Two, maybe three pairs. </p> <p>Tom dived into the shadow.</p> <p>"Cut him off in the back. Radio."</p> <p>Tom rolled to the balls of his feet then sprinted, mind spinning.</p> <p>Radio? </p> <p>The problem with adrenaline, Makatsu's thin voice whispered, is that it makes your head weak. His karate instructor would point to his head and wink. You have plenty of muscle to fight, but no muscle to think.</p> <p>If they had radios and could cut off the street ahead, he would have a very serious problem. </p> <p>He looked frantically for cover. One access to the roof halfway down the alley. One large garbage bin too far away. Scattered boxes to his left. No real cover. He had to make his move before they entered the alley.</p> <p>Fingers of panic stabbed into his mind. Adrenaline dulls reason; panic kills it. Makatsu again. Tom had once been beaten to a pulp by a gang of Filipinos who'd taken a pledge to kill any Americano brat who entered their turf. They made the streets around the army base their turf. His instructor had scolded him, insisting that he was good enough to have escaped their attack that afternoon. His panic had cost him dearly. His brain had been turned to rice pudding, and he deserved the bruises that swelled his eyes shut.</p> <p>This time it was bullets, not feet and clubs, and bullets would leave more than bruises. Time was out. </p> <p>Short on ideas and long on desperation, Tom dived for the gutter. Rough concrete tore at his skin. He rolled quickly to his left, bumped into the brick wall, and lay facedown in the deep shadow.</p> <p>Feet pounded around the corner and ran straight toward him. One man. How they had found him in Denver, four years after the fact, he had no clue. But if they'd gone to this trouble, they wouldn't just walk away.</p> <p>The man ran on light feet, hardly winded. Tom's nose was buried in the musty corner. Noisy blasts of air from his nostrils buffeted his face. He clamped down on his breathing; immediately his lungs began to burn. </p> <p>The slapping feet approached, ran past.</p> <p>Stopped.</p> <p>A slight tremor lit through his bones. He fought another round of panic. It had been six years since his last fight. He didn't stand a chance against a man with a gun. He desperately willed the feet to move on. Walk. Just walk! </p> <p>But the feet didn't walk.</p> <p>They scraped quietly.</p> <p>Tom nearly cried out in his hopelessness. He had to move now, while he still had the advantage of surprise. </p> <p>He threw himself to his left, rolled once to gain momentum. Then twice, rising first to his knees then to his feet. His attacker was facing him, gun extended, frozen.</p> <p>Tom's momentum carried him laterally, directly toward the opposite wall. The gun's muzzle-flash momentarily lit the dark alley and spit a bullet past him. But now instinct had replaced panic. </p> <p>What shoes am I wearing?</p> <p>The question flashed through Tom's mind as he hurdled for the brick wall, left foot leading. A critical question. </p> <p>His answer came when his foot planted on the wall. Rubber soles. One more step up the wall with traction to spare. He threw his head back, arched hard, pushed himself off the brick, then twisted to his right halfway through his rotation. The move was simply an inverted bicycle kick, but he hadn't executed it in half a dozen years, and this time his eyes weren't on a soccer ball tossed up by one of his Filipino friends in Manila.</p> <p>This time it was a gun.</p> <p>The man managed one shot before Tom's left foot smashed into his hand, sending the pistol clattering down the alley. The bullet tugged at his collar.</p> <p>Tom didn't land lightly on his feet as he'd hoped. He sprawled to his hands, rolled once, and sprang into the seventh fighting position opposite a well-muscled man with short-cropped black hair. Not exactly a perfectly executed maneuver. Not terrible for someone who hadn't fought in six years.</p> <p>The man's eyes were round with shock. His experience in the martial arts obviously didn't extend beyond The Matrix. Tom was briefly tempted to shout for joy, but, if anything, he had to shut this man up before he could call out.</p> <p>The man's astonishment suddenly changed to a snarl, and Tom saw the knife in his right hand. Okay, so maybe the man knew more about street-fighting than was at first apparent. </p> <p>He charged Tom.</p> <p>The fury that flooded Tom's veins felt all too welcome. How dare this man shoot at him! How dare he not fall to his knees after such a brilliant kick!</p> <p>Tom ducked the knife's first swipe. Came up with his palm to the man's chin. Bone cracked. </p> <p>It wasn't enough. This man was twice his weight, with twice his muscle, and ten times his bad blood. </p> <p>Tom launched himself vertically and spun into a full roundhouse kick, screaming despite his better judgment. His foot had to be doing a good eighty miles an hour when it struck the man's jaw. </p> <p>They both hit the concrete at precisely the same time-Tom on his feet, ready to deliver another blow; his assailant on his back, breathing hard, ready for the grave. Figuratively speaking.</p> <p>The man's silver pistol lay near the wall. Tom took a step for it, then rejected the notion. What was he going to do? Shoot back? Kill the guy? Incriminate himself? Not smart. He turned and ran back in the direction they'd come. </p> <p>The main alley was empty. He ducked into it, edged along the wall, grabbed the rails to a steel fire escape, and quickly ascended. The building's roof was flat and shouldered another taller building to the south. He swung up to the second building, ran in a crouch, and halted by a large vent, nearly a full block from the alley where he'd laid out the New Yorker. </p> <p>He dropped to his knees, pressed back into the shadows, and listened past the thumping of his heart.</p> <p>The hum of a million tires rolling over asphalt. The distant roar of a jet overhead. The faint sound of idle talk. The sizzling of food frying in a pan, or of water being poured from a window. The former, considering they were in Denver, not the Philippines. No sounds from New York. </p> <p>He leaned back and closed his eyes, catching his breath.</p> <p>Crazy! Fights in Manila as a teenager were one thing, but here in the States at the ripe age of twenty-five? The whole sequence struck him as surreal. It was hard to believe this had just happened to him. </p> <p>Or, more accurately, was happening to him. He still had to figure a way out of this mess. Did they know where he lived? No one had followed him to the roof.</p> <p>Tom crept to the ledge. Another alley ran directly below, adjoining busy streets on either side. Denver's brilliant skyline glimmered on the horizon directly ahead. An odd odor met his nose, sweet like cotton candy but mixed with rubber or something burning.</p> <p>D�j� vu. He'd been here before, hadn't he? No, of course not. Lights shimmered in the hot summer air, reds and yellows and blues, like jewels sprinkled from heaven. He could swear he'd been-</p> <p>Tom's head suddenly snapped to the left. He threw out his arms, but his world spun impossibly and he knew that he was in trouble.</p> <p>Something had hit him. Something like a sledgehammer. Something like a bullet.</p> <p>He felt himself topple, but he wasn't sure if he was really falling or if he was losing consciousness. Something was horribly wrong with his head. </p> <p>He landed hard on his back, in a pillow of black that swallowed his mind whole.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Chapter Two</b></p> <p>the man's eyes snapped open. A pitch-black sky above. No lights, no stars, no buildings. Only black. And a small moon.</p> <p>He blinked and tried to remember where he was. Who he was. But all he could remember was that he'd just had a vivid dream.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and fought to wake. He'd dreamed that he was running from some men who wanted to hurt him. He'd escaped like a spider up a wall after leveling one of the men. Then he'd stared out at the lights. Such beautiful, brilliant lights.

He was born on September 1, 1875 in Chicago, Illinois, and entered military service in 1895. Two years later, he was diagnosed with a heart problem and was discharged. He drifted from job to job and in 1911, he found work selling pencil sharpeners. Because he had plenty of free time during this period, he started reading pulp fiction magazines. He thought that if people were getting paid for writing such rot, then he could write stories which were just as rotten. After seven years of being paid low wages he began writing his own fiction.

With her, we see the fabled Trigorskoye (&#x201c;three hills&#x201d;) estate that Pushkin frequented during his exile, now preserved in his honor. We look for Dostoevsky along the waters of Lake Ilmen, site of the only house the restless writer ever owned. We pay tribute to the single stone that remains of Tol�stoy&#x2019;s birthplace. Wheeler weaves these writers&#x2019; lives and works around their historical homes, giving us rich portraits of the many diverse Russias from which these writers spoke. <br> &nbsp;<br> As she travels, Wheeler follows local guides, boards with families in modest homestays, eats roe and pelmeni and cabbage soup, invokes recipes from <i>Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking, </i>learns the language, and observes the pattern of outcry and silence that characterizes life under Vladimir Putin.

The People Stay Silent</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;The people stay silent.&#x201d; </b><br><b><i>&#x201c;(Narod bezmolvstvuyet.)&#x201d; </i></b><br><b><i>&#x2014;</i>Pushkin,<i> Boris Godunov</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin was a lubricious, bawdy, impet�uous, whoring gambler who seldom missed an opportunity to pick a fight. He never had a proper job, even though he was for a while nominally at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a department of the Chancery. He lived mostly off his father. He had a tortured rela�tionship with both the civil service and the authorities. The govern�ment of Alexander I, the tsar who had defeated Napoleon and was by European standards a medieval figure, was becoming increasingly reactionary, and an incontinent loudmouth like Pushkin had no chance. One prince, a high-level civil servant, recorded in his diary after a dinner in January 1822, &#x201c;Listened to Pushkin at table . . . he tries to convince everyone he meets . . . that only a scoundrel would not wish a change of government in Russia. His favorite conversa�tion is based on abuse and sarcasm and even when he tries to be polite there is a sardonic smile on his lips.&#x201d; Pushkin was opposed to landowners, supported the abolition of serfdom, and indeed when he got going&#x2014;according to the princely dinner companion&#x2014;&#x201c;began to pour abuse on all classes of the population.&#x201d; He announced &#x201c;that all noblemen should be hanged, and that he would tighten the noose round their necks with pleasure.&#x201d; It is a testament to the respect in which literature was held that the government didn&#x2019;t kill him. Of course, three generations later Pushkin&#x2019;s dream of an egalitarian world came true in Russia. But they shot writers then.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pushkin chose to write poems in Russian. Literary Russian had only evolved in the eighteenth century, stimulating a new school of poets from which Pushkin emerged. He turned to prose later. In his short story &#x201c;The Queen of Spades&#x201d; (<i>&#x201c;Pikovaya dama&#x201d;</i>), when the countess asks her grandson if he will bring her a novel, he replies with a ques�tion: Would she like a Russian one? &#x201c;Are there any Russian novels?&#x201d; the countess queries. (As a young woman in the middle of the eigh�teenth century, she read only in French.) Pushkin produced the first major Russian work in almost every literary genre. Just as Peter the Great, standing on the banks of the Neva, founded St. Petersburg &#x201c;to open a window onto Europe,&#x201d; so Pushkin both Russified literary Russian and made his nation&#x2019;s books into something of Europe. And he is contemporary for all time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The young Pushkin, &#x201c;Sasha,&#x201d; grew up with household serfs and then attended the prestigious Imperial Lyc�e, where pupils were not permit�ted to leave during their six-year term. They studied the humanities, following the English public school system, and cultivated the worship of male friendship. (&#x201c;My friends, this brotherhood of ours will live. | United, like the soul, it cannot perish.&#x201d;) Parents could visit on Sundays and feast days, but for two years, as a young teenager, Pushkin never saw his mother. While he was a pupil, Napoleon entered Moscow and for four days the city burned. This was the defining trauma of Pushkin&#x2019;s generation. His uncle was one of many who lost everything. The man fled the city with only the clothes he stood up in.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the summer of 1824 the tsar dismissed the poet from the civil service (besides his political leanings, Pushkin was having an affair with his boss&#x2019;s wife, which can&#x2019;t have helped). Alexander exiled him first to the south, and then to his ancestral estate in the northwest, where he remained under civil and church surveillance in the company of the serf Nikita Timofeyevich Kozlov, who had brought him up. Whenever a friend visited from Petersburg, the pair would hear the sleighbells of the abbot from the local monastery. The old man would shuffle in for a glass of rum, the three would drink and mumble in the candlelit room, and the abbot would ride off again to compose his report.</p><h2>Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory: A Novel of the Civil War (The Gettysburg Trilogy)</h2><p><p>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors of <i>Gettysburg </i>continue their inventive series with this remarkable answer to the great "what-if" of the American Civil War: </p><p>After his great victories at Gettysburg and Union Mills, General Robert E.

We meet him at age six. He doesn&#39;t know where or what America is, but he does know, already, that he&#39;s got round ears that stick out like the sideview mirrors of the only car in town--his father&#39;s. Often he wakes up to find himself tied by his ears to a bedpost, or else he finds loops of string around them, to which are attached dead bugs. &#34;Earrings!&#34; his cousins laugh. His mother tells him something like, It&#39;s only a phase. (This is in Shanghainese.) After a while the other boys will grow up, she says, he should ignore them. Until they grow up? he thinks, and instead--more sensibly--walks around covering his ears with his hands. He presses them back, hoping to train them to bring him less pain. Silly boy! Everyone teases him except his mother, who pleads patiently.&#34;That&#39;s not the way.&#34; She frowns. &#34;Are you listening?&#34; He nods, hands over his ears.&#34;How can you listen with your hands over your ears?&#34;He shrugs. &#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;Back and forth. Until finally, irked, she says what his tutor always says, &#34;You listen but don&#39;t hear!&#34;--distinguishing, the way the Chinese will, between effort and result. Verbs in English are simple. One listens. After all, why should a listening person not hear? What&#39;s taken for granted in English, though, is spelled out in Chinese; there&#39;s even a verb construction for this purpose. Ting de jian in Mandarin means, one listens and hears. Ting bu jian means, one listens but fails to hear. People hear what they can, see what they can, do what they can; that&#39;s the understanding. It&#39;s an old culture talking. Everywhere there are limits.As Ralph, who back then was not Ralph yet, but still Yifeng--Intent on the Peak--already knew. His mother wheedles, patient again. &#34;No hands on your ears during lessons, okay? As it is, you have trouble enough.&#34; If he stops, she promises, she&#39;ll give him preserved plums, mooncakes, money. If he doesn&#39;t, &#34;Do you realize your father will beat me too?&#34;&#34;Lazy,&#34; says his father. &#34;Stupid. What do you do besides eat and sleep all day?&#34; The upright scholar, the ex--government official, calls him a fan tong--a rice barrel. He has an assignment for his son: Yifeng will please study his Older Sister. He will please observe everything she does, and simply copy her.His Older Sister (Yifeng calls her Bai Xiao, Know-It-All) blushes.Hands over his ears, Yifeng presses, presses, presses.It&#39;s 1947; Yifeng&#39;s more or less grown up. The Anti-Japanese War has been over for two years. Now there&#39;s wreckage, and inflation, and moral collapse. Or so it seems to his father as, on a fan-cooled veranda, he entertains apocalyptic thoughts of marching armies, a new dynasty, the end of society as they know it.&#34;Might there be something nicer to talk about?&#34; suggests his mother.But his father will talk destruction and gloom if he wants to. Degeneracy! he says. Stupidity! Corruption! These have been his lifelong enemies; thanks to them he no longer holds office.&#34;Too much rice wine,&#34; muses Ralph&#39;s mother.This is in a small town in Jiangsu province, outside Shanghai, a place of dusty shops and rutted roads, of timber and clay--a place where every noise has a known source. Somewhere in the city, the girl who will become Helen hums Western love songs to herself; on a convent school diamond, Know-It-All (that is, Theresa) fields grounders from her coach. Ralph, though--Yifeng--is on his way home from his job at the Transportation Department. His mother knows this. As his father prepares to write an article--he has an inkstone out, and a wolf&#39;s hair maobi--his mother prepares to speak up.His father announces that he&#39;s going to write about Degeneracy! Stupidity! Corruption!&#34;America,&#34; his mother says then.His father goes on grinding his ink. Yifeng simply cannot be going abroad.&#34;But it seems, perhaps, that he is.&#34;Silence. His father&#39;s hand hovers over the inkstone, circling. He presses just so hard, no harder. He holds his ink stick upright.A fellowship from the government! Field training! His son, an advanced engineer! No one knows what&#39;s possible like a father. His ink blackens; and in the end he can&#39;t be kept from making a few discreet inquiries, among friends. This is how he discovers that things are indeed more involved than they at first appeared. Though Yifeng has scored seventeenth on the department exam, he is one of the ten picked to go.&#34;No door like a back door,&#34; says his father. &#34;Your only son,&#34; pleads his mother.His father looks away. &#34;Opposites begin in one another,&#34; he says. And, &#34;Yi dai qing qing, qi dai huai&#34;--one generation pure, the next good for nothing.Of course, in the end, Yifeng did come to the United States anyway, his stomach burbling with fool hope. But it was privately, not through the government, and not for advanced field training, but for graduate study. A much greater opportunity, as everyone agreed. He could bring back a degree!&#34;A degree,&#34; he echoed dully.His mother arranged a send-off banquet, packed him a black trunk full of Western-style clothes.&#34;Your father would like to give you this,&#34; she told him at the dock. As his father stared off into the Shanghai harbor--at the true ships in the distance, the ragtag boats by the shore--she slid a wristwatch into Yifeng&#39;s hand.Yifeng nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll remember him always.&#34;It was hot.On the way to America, Yifeng studied. He reviewed his math, his physics, his English, struggling for long hours with his broken-backed books, and as the boat rocked and pitched he set out two main goals for himself. He was going to be first in his class, and he was not going home until he had his doctorate rolled up to hand his father. He also wrote down a list of subsidiary aims.1. I will cultivate virtue. (A true scholar being a good scholar; as the saying went, there was no carving rotten wood.)2. I will bring honor to the family.What else?3. I will do five minutes of calisthenics daily.4. I will eat only what I like, instead of eating everything.5. 1 will on no account keep eating after everyone else has stopped.6. I will on no account have anything to do with girls.On 7 through 10, he was stuck until he realized that number 6 about the girls was so important it counted for at least four more than itself. For girls, he knew, were what happened to even the cleverest, most diligent, most upright of scholars; the scholars kissed, got syphilis, and died without getting their degrees.He studied in the sun, in the rain, by every shape moon. The ocean sang and spit; it threw itself on the deck. Still he studied. He studied as the horizon developed, finally, a bit of skin--land! He studied as that skin thickened, and deformed, and resolved, shaping itself as inevitably as a fetus growing eyes, growing ears. Even when islands began to heave their brown, bristled backs up through the sea (a morning sea so shiny it seemed to have turned into light and light and light), he watched only between pages. For this was what he&#39;d vowed as a corollary of his main aim--to study until he could see the pylons of the Golden Gate Bridge.That splendor! That radiance! True, it wasn&#39;t the Statue of Liberty, but still in his mind its span glowed bright, an image of freedom, and hope, and relief for the seasick. The day his boat happened into harbor, though, he couldn&#39;t make out the bridge until he was almost under it, what with the fog; and all there was to hear were foghorns. These honked high, low, high, low, over and over, like a demented musician playing his favorite two notes.How was anyone supposed to be able to read?Years later, when he told this story, he&#39;d claim that the only sightseeing he did was to make a trip back to the bridge, in better weather, to have his picture taken. Unfortunately, he forgot his camera. As for the train ride to New York--famous mountains lumbered by, famous rivers, plains, canyons, the whole holy American spectacle, without his looking up once.&#34;So how&#39;d you know what you were passing, then,&#34; his younger daughter would ask. (This was Mona, who was just like that, a mosquito.)&#34;I hear what other people talk,&#34; he&#39;d say--at least usually. Once, though, he blushed. &#34;I almost never take a look at.&#34; He shrugged, sheepish. &#34;Interesting.&#34;New York. He admitted that maybe he had taken a look around there too. And what of it? The idea city still gleamed then, after all, plus this was the city of cities, a place that promised to be recalled as an era. Ralph toured the century to date--its subway, its many mighty bridges, its highways. He was awed by the Empire State Building. Those pilings! He wondered at roller coasters, Ferris wheels. At cafeterias--eating factories, these seemed to him, most advanced and efficient, especially the Automats with their machines lit bright as a stage. The mundane details of life impressed him too--the neatly made milk cartons, the spring-loaded window shades, the electric iceboxes everywhere. Only he even saw these things, it seemed; only he considered how they had been made, the gears turning, the levers tilting. Even haircuts done by machine here! The very air smelled of oil. Nothing was made of bamboo.He did notice.By and large, though, he really did study. He studied as he walked, as he ate. The first week. The second week.The third week, however, what could happen even to the cleverest, most diligent, most upright of scholars (and he was at least diligent, he allowed) happened to him.&#34;She was some--what you call?--tart,&#34; he said.A BOYWITH HIS HATOVER HIS CROTCHPICTURE HIM. Young, orotund. Longish hair managed with grease. A new, light gray, too dressy, double-breasted suit made him look even shorter than his five feet three and three-quarter inches. Otherwise he was himself--large-faced, dimpled, with eyebrows that rode nervously up and up, away from his flat, wide, placid nose. He had small teeth set in vast expanses of gum; those round ears; and delicate, almost maidenly skin that tended to flush and pale with the waxing and waning of his digestive problems. Everywhere he went, he carried a Panama hat with him, though he never put it on, and it was always in his way; he seemed to have picked up an idea about gentlemen, or hats--something--that was proving hard to let go.In sum, he was a doll, and the Foreign Student Affairs secretary, though she loathed her job, loathed her boss, loathed working, liked him.&#34;Name?&#34; he repeated, or rather &#34;nem,&#34; which he knew to be wrong. He turned red, thinking of his trouble with long a&#39;s, th&#39;s, l&#39;s, consonants at the ends of words. Was it beneath a scholar to hate the alphabet? Anyway, he did.&#34;Naaame,&#34; she said, writing it down. She&#39;d seen this before, foreign students who could read and write and speak a little, but who just couldn&#39;t get the conversation. N-A-M-E.&#34;Name Y. F. Chang.&#34; (His surname as he pronounced it then sounded like the beginning of angst; it would be years before he was used to hearing Chang rhyme with twang.)&#34;Eng-lish-name,&#34; said Cammy. E-N-G-L-I-S-H-N-A-M-E.&#34;I Chin-ese,&#34; he said, and was about to explain that Y. F. were his initials when she laughed.&#34;Eng-lish-name,&#34; she said again.&#34;What you laughing?&#34;Later he realized this to be a very daring thing to ask, that he never would have asked a Chinese girl why she was laughing. But then, a Chinese girl never would have been laughing, not like that. Not a nice Chinese girl, anyway. What a country he was in!&#34;I&#39;m laughing at you.&#34; Her voice rang, playful yet deeper than he would have expected. She smelled of perfume. He could not begin to guess her age. &#34;At you!&#34;&#34;Me?&#34; With mock offense, he drew his chin back.&#34;You,&#34; she said again. &#34;Me?&#34; &#34;You.&#34; &#34;Me?&#34; They were joking! In English! Shuo de chu--he spoke, and the words came out! Ting de dong--he listened and understood!&#34;English name,&#34; she said again, finally. She showed him her typewriter, the form she had to fill out.&#34;No English name.&#34; How to say initials? He was sorry to disappoint her. Then he brightened. &#34;You give me.&#34;&#34;I-give-you-a-name?&#34;&#34;Sure. You give.&#34; There was something about speaking English that carried him away.&#34;I&#39;ll-hang-onto-this-form-overnight,&#34; she tried to tell him. &#34;That-way-you-find-a-name-you-like-better-you-can-tell-me-tomorrow.&#34;Too much, he didn&#39;t get it. Anyway, he waited, staring--exercising the outsider&#39;s privilege, to be rude. How colorful she was! Orange hair, pink face, blue eyes. Red nails. Green dress. And under the dress, breasts large and solid as earthworks. He thought of the burial mounds that dotted the Chinese countryside--the small mounds for nobodies, the big mounds for big shots. This woman put him in mind of the biggest mound he had ever seen: in Shandong, that was, Confucius&#39;s grave.Meanwhile, she ran through her ex-beaux. Robert? Eugene? Norman? She toyed with a stray curl. Fred? John? Steve? Ken? &#34;Ralph,&#34; she said finally. She wrote it down. R-A-L-P-H. &#34;Do you like it?&#34;&#34;Sure!&#34; He beamed.Walking home, though, Ralph was less sanguine. Had he been too hasty? He did this, he knew; he dispensed with things, trying to be like other people--decisive, practical--only to discover he&#39;d overdone it. His stomach puckered with anxiety. And sure enough, when he asked around later he found that the other Chinese students (there were five of them in the master&#39;s degree program) had all stuck with their initials, or picked names for themselves, carefully, or else had wise people help them.&#34;Ralph,&#34; said smooth-faced Old Chao (Old Something-or-another being what younger classmates called older classmates, who in turn called them Little Something-or-another). He looked it up in a book he had. &#34;Means wolf,&#34; he said, then looked that up in a dictionary. &#34;A kind of dog,&#34; he translated.A kind of dog, thought Ralph.For himself, Old Chao had Henry, which turned out to be the name of at least eight kings. &#34;My father picked it for me,&#34; he said.It would have been better if Ralph sounded a bit more like Yifeng; in the art of picking English names (which everyone seemed to know except him), that was considered desirable. But so what? And who cared what it meant? Ralph decided that what was on the form didn&#39;t matter. He was a man with a mission; what mattered was that he register for the right courses, that he attend the right classes, that he buy the right books. All of this proved more difficult than he&#39;d anticipated. He discovered, for instance, that he wasn&#39;t on the class list for two of his courses, and that for one of them, enrollment was already closed. To address these problems, he did what he did when his tuition didn&#39;t arrive, and when his other two classes turned out to meet at the same time: he found his way to the Foreign Student Affairs Office, where gaily colored Cammy would help him.</p><h2>Legal Tender</h2><p><p>Bennie Rosato is a maverick lawyer, and business at her law firm has never been better.

This densely illustrated book vividly presents and preserves the waterfront's development. Superb watercolor, ink, and pencil drawings&#x2014;some specially created for this publication&#x2014;as well as rare historic pictures, aerial photographs, and maps culled from a wide variety of sources and reproduced here for the first time, make this book the most comprehensive study on the subject. Newly commissioned photographs by Stanley Greenberg supplement this already rich array of images, often bringing out the melancholy beauty of the waterfront in its present derelict state.<br><br> Also seen here are many major modern sites&#x2014;the Red Hook Water Pollution Control Plant, the Port Authority Grain Elevators, the Fresh Kills Landfill, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard&#x2014;capturing the nameless, inhospitable tracts whose only landmarks are the rusting remains of a once vital commercial life. This illustrative material, together with a series of informative texts written by critics and scholars, reveals a complete picture of the New York waterfront through contemporary projects and visionary proposals, environmental plans and master-planning, built and unbuilt waterfront structures (pier warehouses, recreation piers, markets, and ferry terminals), in addition to a meticulous analysis of a variety of documents and records.<br><br> <i>The New York Waterfront</i> offers a unique perspective on waterfront building so that the lessons of the past can inform decisions about the future. This publication also inspires us to strive for an equivalent greatness when designing the urban fabric of the twenty-first century, the kind of greatness in public works that has in the past distinguished New York City.</p><p>Ever since Peter Stuyvesant established the first pier in the 1640s, the New York City waterfront has been a hotbed of controversy and conflicting special interests. Not until 1871 did the city institute the Department of Docks to bring some order to the port and harbor; prior to that, the city's 112 piers were all under the authority of different agencies, and by the 1870s the entire infrastructure had decayed; wooden wharves were dilapidated, rat-infested, and unsafe. To impose some method upon the maritime madness, the city created its Department of Docks under General George B. McClellan. For 60 years the waterfront thrived, until New Jersey replaced New York as a final destination for container ships; now the area is once again in decline. <p> In <i>The New York Waterfront,</i> historians, students, architects, and teachers take a look at where the port and harbor have been and speculate about their future. The six essays in this book offer both a historical context and a commentary on solutions, both hypothetical and those in-progress. It is as much about New York's civic culture as about its waterfront, and thus it's a fascinating read, even for those without a vested interest in the future of the harbor.</p>Kevin Bone is an associate professor of architecture at the Irwin S.

Narrator Jesse Berns helps listeners slip right into the oddly engaging world that Riordan creates, in which contemporary teen characters and those from classical mythology intermingle. Berns is so good at accurately portraying teenagers that it's hard to recall he isn't one; Percy's sarcasm and disdainful tones ("Dude?") are just right, though Berns also reveals his ability to become a satyr, cyclops, or guinea pig ("Reep! Reep!") as required. Berns keeps the pace masterfully taut while also allowing listeners time to revel in the book's humor. J.C.G.

By simply allowing ourselves to be guided by our innate intelligence and generosity, which are our authentic nature, we are able to be compassionately present to what&#x2019;s happening now. Compassionate self-discipline&#x2014;the will to take positive steps in life&#x2014;is found through nothing other than being present. When we are present and aware, we are not engaged in distracting, addictive behaviors. If we simply cultivate our ability to pay attention and focus on what is here in this moment, our experience can be authentic, awake, honest, and joyful. <br><br>The book includes a guided thirty-day program of daily meditation, contemplation, and journaling.</p><p>Cheri Huber is a Zen teacher and the author of eighteen popular books. She founded A Center for the Practice of Zen Buddhist Meditation in Mountain View, California, in 1983, and the Zen Monastery Retreat Center in Murphys, California, in 1987.

She lives in Murphys, California.&nbsp;"Huber has been a Zen teacher for many years, but this does not feel at all like a Zen book. . . .

The virgin&#39;s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &#34;Greetings favoured one! The Lord is with you.&#34; But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, &#34;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.&#34;&#39;The drama, the symbolism, the poignant simplicity of the imagined scene evoked by these words, have proved irresistible to artists over the centuries. Presented here, in a chronological sequence, are over 100 of the finest representations of this encounter. All depicting the same subject, yet all wonderfully and subtly different, these images are an inexhaustible source of pleasure and inspiration, taking the viewer on a journey of meditation through the ages. The design of the book is simple and the theme is unchanging, but the outcome is rich and endlessly varied.While the message is Christian, the human drama of the Annunciation has a universal appeal; the artists, attempting to express an awe-inspiring mystery, have at the same time invested the scene with the deepest humanity.

Through a well-reasoned and logical process, Polkinghorne argues that reality consists not only of the scientific processes of the natural world but also the personal dimension of human nature and its significance. He offers an integrated view of reality, encompassing a range of insights deriving from physics&#x2019; account of causal structure, evolutionary understanding of human nature, the unique significance of Jesus of Nazareth, and the human encounter with God.<p></p>The author devotes further chapters to specific problems and questions raised by the Christian account of divine reality. He discusses, for example, the nature of time and God&#x2019;s relation to it, the interrelationship of the world&#x2019;s faiths, the problem of evil, and practical ethical issues relating to genetic advances, including stem cell research. Continuing in his pursuit of a dialogue between science and theology that accords equal weight to the insights of each, Polkinghorne expands our understanding of the nature of reality and our appreciation of its complexity.<p></p></p><p><b>John Polkinghorne, KBE, FRS, </b>is fellow and retired president of Queens&#x2019; College, Cambridge. Winner of the 2002 Templeton Prize, he is both a quantum physicist and an Anglican priest.<p></p>Starred Review. According to the physicist-priest Polkinghorne, "If the physicists seem to achieve their ends more successfully than the theologians, that is simply a reflection of how much easier science is than theology." Without abandoning his general standpoint as both a scientist and a theologian, Polkinghorne's essays pursue a wider set of interests, acknowledging terrain where theology becomes difficult and uncertain work. Reflections on issues of space-time, quantum mechanics and chaos theory&#x2014;familiar from Polkinghorne's previous books&#x2014;are joined by essays on human nature, the problem of evil, the historical Jesus and the relationship between Christianity and other faiths. Polkinghorne's basic approach remains consistent: he is a friend of science, but a foe of scientific reductionism, arguing that "nothing [science] can tell us requires us to deny our directly experienced human capacity" to act responsibly and seek meaning in the universe. Surveying human aptitudes for self-consciousness, language, rationality, creativity, moral awareness and the "slantedness" of human life that theologians call sin, Polkinghorne concludes, "how strange it is that many biologists... claim not to be able so see anything really distinctive about <i>Homo sapiens</i>." Balancing intellectual modesty with openness about his own Christian faith, Polkinghorne's reflections will engage both thoughtful believers and inquirers into issues of faith and reason. <i>(Nov. 29)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Even the most amazing things become objects of lust: Banana, dildo, cucumber, plug, cooking whisk, saveloy sausage, double dong, apple. Idoia is the queen of detournement. Her appetite is such that she even introduces giant silicone dildos in both her holes. She has fun trying out ever new stuff. Between her legs or between her buttocks, nothing can resist her. Idoia radiates with such an urge for orgasms that she sometimes makes herself cum entirely, by stuffing her hand up to her wrist into her vagina and into her dilated anus. But the very pinnacle of eroticism is reached when the pictures show her vulva swollen with a pussy pump. Just like the goddess of flowers from Botticelli&#39;s painting Spring, with vine-shoot squirting out of her mouth, Idoia embodies lust. Even her panty disappears in her pussy -- anything makes Idoia cum.</p><p></p><h2>New and Collected Poems</h2><p>Spanning four decades of work and encompassing the poet&#39;s six previously published volumes of poetry, twenty-seven new poems, and a cantata, this volume represents the lifetime work of the man invested as Poet Laureate of the United States, October 1987</p><p>These collected poems of the Poet Laureate of the United States are, despite the prevailing view of modern poetry, a monument to the accessible and the beautiful.

One of the essays, "Joseph de Maistre and the Origins of Fascism," is published here for the first time; this reevaluation of the Savoyard counterrevolutionary occupies almost a quarter of the book, and not a word is wasted.<p> Although written separately, these essays exhibit a common concern with what Berlin calls pluralism, the idea that there can be different, equally valid but mutually incompatible, conceptions of how to live. Whatever their disagreements, traditional writers on politics have implicitly assumed that there is one best way to live, whether it was in the static utopias of More and Harrington or in the dynamic dramas of Hegel and Marx. But in the 18th century, Vico and Herder embraced pluralism, thus inaugurating the historicist turn in political thought. Berlin adeptly pursues pluralism and its repercussions through history, connecting it to the decline of utopian ideas, the origins of fascism and nationalism, the rise of the discipline of cultural history, and much else.</p><p> As always, Berlin's prose is graceful and powerful, but what truly makes <i>The Crooked Timber of Humanity</i> exhilarating to read is the depth and power of his intellect. Berlin credits Vico with realizing that "to exercise their proper function, historians require the capacity for imaginative insight, without which the bones of the past remain dry and lifeless." It is a capacity that Berlin himself amply displays here. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>loquence and erudition, our most eminent living philosopher traces the connections between the ideas of the past and the political and social cataclysms of our time.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Tempt Me (The Fallen Women Series, 1)</h2><p><p>Spunky English girl overcomes impossible odds and outsmarts heathen villains.</p><p>That's the headline when Zoe Lexham returns to England.

Squirrel loves his. But then their delicious vegetables begin disappearing. And they have only each other to blame . . . or do they?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Rabbit and Squirrel don't pause to consider any other possibilities. And so, for them, there's only one option: WAR! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the team that hatched the award-winning <i>Ugly Fish</i>, here is a hilarious cautionary tale about how jumping to conclusions can turn minor misunderstandings into <i>major</i> meltdowns.</p><p><b>KARA LAREAU</b> is a children's book editor and the author of&nbsp;the Rocko and Spanky series.

W. Flaherty as well as his own&nbsp;<i>Hugo and Miles in&nbsp;I've Painted Everything</i>. He lives in Reading, Massachusetts.<br>Though Rabbit and Squirrel are both avid gardeners and next-door neighbors, they are not friends. They never share gardening tips or produce, and they never even speak to each other. One fateful day something horrible happens: Rabbit wakes up and finds her garden has been ravaged! She blames Squirrel. The next day, when Squirrel's garden has been stripped of some of his peas and tomatoes, he blames Rabbit and throws a rotten tomato at her house. Then, when all of the produce disappears, he flushes her out of her house with a hose. That is when the true culprit&#x2014;a very large human gardener&#x2014;arrives on the scene and chases both Rabbit and Squirrel into the dark woods. Even though they are in the woods together, they refuse to abandon their battle. The book ends with the optimistic line, "One of these days, they'll grow tired of fighting. And then, hopefully, they'll learn to grow something new." Children will enjoy the way illustrator Scott Magoon's cartoonish images reveal the human hand plucking produce from the animals' gardens, giving them information unknown to Rabbit and Squirrel. While careful listeners will observe that though Rabbit was not the first one to raid squirrel's garden, she did not hesitate to take what was left in retaliation for his first attack on her house. A lighthearted look at conflict, this story provides numerous opportunities to discuss the best methods of coping with a variety of circumstances, from being a good neighbor to avoiding jumping to conclusions. It is also an unusual addition to class units on farms and gardens.

Reprint.</p><p>Forward's first novel gives the concept of the balance between good and evil a most ingenious twist: What if good were so totally triumphant that it became a worse danger than evil, and a band of unemployed evil characters had to go on a desperate quest to find the means of putting the saving bit of evil back into the world? The result of this twist is an almost straightforward quest tale, with numerous well-drawn characters (including a centaur who starts off as a secret agent for good and eventually joins the side of evil), great ingenuity about magic, very creditable world-building, and considerable wit. Although bearing its share of first-novel flaws, it has many more virtues, which include an underlying, serious examination of the good-evil dichotomy that is the basis of so many role-playing games. <i>Roland Green</i>With the banishment of Evil from the realms, the final victory of Good is assured-unless a few stalwart antiheroes can save the world from a serious and potentially fatal imbalance. First novelist Forward explores the complications that arise from a surfeit of "goodness" in the world. The result is a skewed version of the epic fantasy that features an assassin, a thief, an evil sorceress, a dark knight, and an implacable druid as the villains-turned-heroes who must restore the delicate balance of opposing forces before their world disappears in a blinding flash of Goodness and Light.

At the nexus was the underground, cable-access show <i>New Wave Theatre</i>, hosted by the visionary Peter Ivers. Pre-MTV, the show forged a groundbreaking union between comedy and punk, placing comedians like John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Harold Ramis onstage with Black Flag, the Dead Kennedys, and Fear. On the cusp of mainstream recognition, <i>New Wave Theatre</i> came to a sudden end on March 3, 1983 when Ivers was found beaten to death in his downtown Los Angeles loft. The show was forgotten, but Ivers&#x2019;s influence on pop culture has lasted. A magnetic creative force, his circle included Doug Kenney, Jello Biafra, David Lynch, Ramis, and Belushi. He was also a fascinating musician: in addition to composing the centerpiece song on the soundtrack of Lynch&#x2019;s cult classic film <i>Eraserhead</i>, Ivers recorded seven albums. Josh Frank&#x2019;s research inspired renewed interest in Ivers, and the abandoned murder investigation was reopened. Through his narration and interviews with the LAPD and those close to Ivers, Frank brings this underappreciated and compelling creative figure to life.</p><p><b>Josh Frank</b> is the author (with Caryn Ganz) of <i>Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies</i> and a screenwriter, composer, and director.<p>chapter 1</p><p><b>I March Forth!</b></p><p><b>Brookline, Massachusetts, 1956, 4:15 p.m.</b></p><p>Merle Ivers finished up some household chores and turned to her real work of the day. Peter would be home from school soon; what music should she play for him today? She flipped through her record collection. A classical symphony, a selection of jazz standards, a Broadway show? Peter seemed to love them all as much as she did -- and to appreciate them with an almost uncanny level of sophistication. In addition to music, his interests at this age included soccer and an intense preoccupation with the intricacies and nuances of human relationships. He was a small boy, but naturally active and athletic, charismatic and always well liked. And he liked the girls. It didn't hurt that he had a devastating set of what Merle had always thought of as "bedroom eyes."</p><p>Merle was open and encouraging of Peter and her daughter Ricki's interests and quirky turns of mind. She was also disciplined, at times strict, about ensuring that their minds and bodies were consistently stimulated, challenged, and engaged. She believed that children needed structure, but not because she was invested in either of her children conforming to societal norms. In a way, it was just the opposite: from her love of music she knew that structure provided the possibility for creative exploration. She felt that the right musical education would enable her children to learn this, and so she put great care into planning Peter's musical diet, carefully selecting just the right record to feed his mind and soul on any given day.</p><p>It was this core set of values, and her close relationships with her children, that had brought Merle's young family relatively unscathed through a set of very difficult years. Her first husband, Jordan Rose, was a doctor who had developed a rare cancer two years after Peter was born. They'd lived in Chicago until 1948, when the disease attacked his lungs and forced the family to relocate to Arizona, where his lungs could benefit from the clean dry air. He died a year later, a few months after Ricki's birth.</p><p><i>Ah</i>, Guys and Dolls, Merle thought, sliding the show tune from the stack. <i>Perfect</i>. She held it, reconsidered, and returned it to its sleeve. <i>Maybe today is a better day for jazz.</i></p><p>A widow at twenty-six with two young children in tow, Merle moved back in with her parents in Chicago. But she was an optimist, and she disciplined herself against despair. Only a few months after Jordan's death, she took a trip to Florida, where she met thirty-one-year-old Paul Isenstein, a former Bostonian who had retired to the bachelor's life after some early success in the textile business. Though perhaps not jazz's biggest fan -- he played the reserved, conservative straight man to Merle's free spirit -- Isenstein was a good man. And, most important, he was instantly and fervently <i>Merle's</i> biggest fan. Paul wanted to marry her immediately. And after getting to know him better, she was crazy for him, too. (The only thing she was not crazy for was his last name, which she found too provincial. She picked "Ivers" out of a phone book, and Paul, in his zealotry to win her over, took it on as his own.)</p><p><i>Nineteen-�fifty -- a good year for jazz</i>, Merle thought, flipping through her records. She still had not decided what to play for Peter today.</p><p>Merle and the kids moved to Paul's apartment in Brookline, a suburb of Boston. A few years after they married, he set up his own successful business and soon moved the family into a proper house. Like his new wife, the children's education was always Paul's topmost concern.</p><p>Merle could not have been happier. Within this bubble of upper-middle-class safety and comfort, her maternal instincts took flight. She sent eight-year-old Peter and six-year-old Ricki to sleepaway camp in Maine. When Peter lost interest in recreational camping, Merle insisted he find another productive use of his time. He chose a lab-science camp. Later, when he tired of that, Merle insisted he find a job. That summer, at age fourteen, he worked at the zoo.</p><p>Paul Ivers, though by nature less demonstrative than Merle and by necessity less involved in the day-to-day parenting, was nonetheless a loving, attentive, and above all dependable father throughout Peter and Ricki's childhood years. No matter what professional responsibilities vied for his attention, he could be counted on to appear in the cheering section of any soccer game or school play.</p><p><i>Or</i>, Merle mused, <i>maybe today is a classical day? Mendelssohn or Mozart? Symphony or sonata?</i></p><p>Usually, choosing Peter's music was an almost meditative time for Merle. But today her mind was not totally at ease. A few weeks ago his fifth-grade teacher had called her in for a private conference. Swearing Merle to secrecy, the teacher pleaded with her to take Peter out of the public school system. If her advice were discovered it could mean losing her job, but she felt it would be the best thing Merle could ever do for her son. "There is no way I'm going to be able to keep him focused," she had said, "there is just not enough here to satisfy his thirst for knowledge."</p><p>Roxbury Latin was the oldest continuously running preparatory school in the country, and one of the most prestigious. The teacher felt certain that it was the only kind of environment in which Peter could truly flourish. Its entrance standards were extremely competitive, and for the last several years Harvard University had been administering aptitude tests that played a key role in the admissions process. Merle had brought both Ricki and Peter in for the test, and the results were supposed to arrive in the mail any day. Merle could frankly care less about the test per se, the status and prestige. She just wanted to provide the optimal educational environment for her kids, and she felt confident that she could get them into a good school irrespective of the results of one test.</p><p>Paul, on the other hand, saw performance on a test like this as a barometer for all future performance in life. A good score would reflect that Peter had what it took, for example, to inherit the business Paul had grown from nothing, manage it effectively, make it flourish, and provide for his family even better than Paul had been able to provide for his. Though Merle knew Paul's heart was in the right place, his anxiety over the impending test results had recently brought an edge of tension into their home.</p><p><i>Ah, yes</i>, Merle thought. <i>This is the one. Here we go</i>. She drew the day's album gently out of its sleeve and blew on it lightly, clearing the dust. She fixed it in place on the player, set the needle down gently, and waited for the opening chords.</p><p>Moments later she heard Peter's footsteps tracking up the walk, through the door. When he entered the room all her worries evaporated, like ghosts exposed to daylight. His little face was so open yet so certain. Eyes voraciously curious, yet seeming to hold some profound hidden understanding. One look at him and she knew everything would be fine.</p><p>Then she realized that Peter himself did not seem totally fine, his mind appeared to be chewing on some concerns of its own. He didn't wait for her to ask what was wrong. He was worried, he told her, because he'd heard that the atomic bomb was coming and they were all going to be killed.</p><p>Merle wanted to reassure him but did not want to say something false or pat. It went against her nature and everything she believed about being a good parent. (The first and only time she had ever spanked Ricki was when, at age three, she told a lie. Peter had stood outside the house in protest, wailing, far more upset than Ricki herself.) But more important, he would see right through it. At ten, Peter had an unnervingly sharp eye for discerning falseness and authenticity. Platitudes would do nothing to calm him, but she had an idea of what would.</p><p>"Peter," Merle said. "What are you worried about? If the atomic bomb comes, we're all going to go. You won't be alone. If you go, I'm going, too. We'll all be together."</p><p>Peter focused his eyes and nodded slowly. Finally his mouth opened into a grin.</p><p>Later that afternoon, as mother and son chatted about his day to a soundtrack of jazz standards, Paul burst through the front door waving a piece of mail high in the air, his face lit up by a radiant smile.</p><p>"He's a genius!" Paul proclaimed. "Harvard says Peter is a genius!"<br><br></p><p><b>HEADLINES:</b></p><p><b>New York City, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, 1969</b></p><p>Mr. Ivers performed to a well-�dressed Lincoln Center audience in what ap-�peared to be quite a handsome pair of polka-�dot pajamas and bunny-�earedslippers. -- <i>New York Times</i>, 1969<b></b></p><p><b><b>PETER JOHNSON</b>, friend from Harvard<br></b>"He would show up and wear his pajamas and play.

The book features four or five patterns from each designer, along with an essay on their careers and how they entered the field of knitwear design. The more than 50 patterns range in date from the first Aran pattern commercially published in the United States (1958) to Chin's Reversible Rib Shawl published in the Winter 99/00 issue of Vogue Knitting.

Or an alternative economic model that is untainted by the greed and crises of current financial systems? Christian Felber says it is. Moreover, in <i>Change Everything</i> he shows us how. In this new and updated edition of the book that sparked a global movement, Felber proposes a blueprint for an economics of everybody: ethical, dignified, sustainable, and principled. He shows that The Economy for the Common Good is not just an idea, but has already become a broad international movement with thousands of people, companies, communities, and organizations participating, developing, and implementing it.</p><p><b>Christian Felber</b> is an economist and university lecturer at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.

In Change Everything Felber lays out a plan for this new society, based on the idea that &#x2018;all economic activity should serve the common good.&#x2019; . . .

This elegant, wise, fascinating, deeply moving book is an instant classic. I&#x2019;m about to buy it for everyone I know.&#x201d; &#x2015;Maggie Nelson, author of <i>The Argonauts</i></b></p><p><b>A brave, brilliant, and unprecedented examination of menopause</b></p><p>Menopause hit Darcey Steinke hard. First came hot flashes. Then insomnia. Then depression. As she struggled to express what was happening to her, she came up against a culture of silence. Throughout history, the natural physical transition of menopause has been viewed as something to deny, fear, and eradicate. Menstruation signals fertility and life, and childbirth is revered as the ultimate expression of womanhood. Menopause is seen as a harbinger of death. Some books Steinke found promoted hormone replacement therapy. Others encouraged acceptance. But Steinke longed to understand menopause in a more complex, spiritual, and intellectually engaged way.</p><p>In <i>Flash Count Diary, </i>Steinke writes frankly about aspects of Menopause that have rarely been written about before. She explores the changing gender landscape that comes with reduced hormone levels, and lays bare the transformation of female desire and the realities of prejudice against older women. Weaving together her personal story with philosophy, science, art, and literature, Steinke reveals that in the seventeenth century, women who had hot flashes in front of others could be accused of being witches; that the model for Duchamp's famous <i>�tant donn�s</i> was a post-reproductive woman; and that killer whales&#x2015;one of the only other species on earth to undergo menopause&#x2015;live long post-reproductive lives. </p><p><i>Flash Count Diary, </i>with its deep research, open play of ideas, and reverence for the female body, will change the way you think about menopause. It's a deeply feminist book&#x2015;honest about the intimations of mortality that menopause brings while also arguing for the ascendancy, beauty, and power of the post-reproductive years.</p></p><p><b>Darcey Steinke</b> is the author of the memoir <i>Easter Everywhere </i>and the novels <i>Milk</i>, <i>Jesus Saves</i>, <i>Suicide Blonde</i>, <i>Up Through the Water</i>, and <i>Sister Golden Hair</i>.

Steinke makes the case that the inexorable slide away from fertility is a rebirth of agency, and her book is the fruit of the very creativity it describes." <b>&#x2015;Sarah Manguso, <i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p>"[An] incandescent account of menopause . . .

Caleb Everett brings new insights in psychology, anthropology, primatology, linguistics, and other disciplines to bear in explaining the myriad human behaviors and modes of thought numbers have made possible, from enabling us to conceptualize time in new ways to facilitating the development of writing, agriculture, and other advances of civilization.</p><p>Number concepts are a human invention&#x2015;a tool, much like the wheel, developed and refined over millennia. Numbers allow us to grasp quantities precisely, but they are not innate. Recent research confirms that most specific quantities are not perceived in the absence of a number system. In fact, without the use of numbers, we cannot precisely grasp quantities greater than three; our minds can only estimate beyond this surprisingly minuscule limit.</p><p>Everett examines the various types of numbers that have developed in different societies, showing how most number systems derived from anatomical factors such as the number of fingers on each hand. He details fascinating work with indigenous Amazonians who demonstrate that, unlike language, numbers are not a universal human endowment.

With a soft patter, rain began to streak the glass, and the sky darkened to a bruise. Fogging the window, Max blinked at his own watery reflection in the glass. It blinked back at him: a dark-eyed boy with wavy black hair and his mother&#x2019;s sharp cheekbones.<br><br>His father&#x2019;s voice rumbled beside him, and Max turned in his seat.<br><br>&#x201c;Which do you like better?&#x201d; his father asked with an enthusiastic grin. He held a pair of glossy advertisements between his thick fingers. Max looked at the ads, his gaze settling on the image of an elegant woman at a kitchen sink, her head thrown back in amusement.<br><br>&#x201c;Not that one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s way too cheesy.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. McDaniels&#x2019;s broad, smiling face drooped. Big as a bear, Max&#x2019;s father had pale blue eyes and a deep, dimpled chin.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not cheesy,&#x201d; he protested, squinting at the ad and smoothing his tuft of thinning brown hair. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s cheesy about it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s that happy doing dishes,&#x201d; said Max, pointing at the beaming woman up to her elbows in suds. &#x201c;And nobody does the dishes in a fancy dress&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the whole point!&#x201d; interrupted his father, waving the flimsy ad about. &#x201c;Ambrosia is the first &#x2018;ultra-premium&#x2019; dish soap! A heavenly lather that&#x2019;s soft enough for the tub, but still has muscle for the toughest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Max flushed. &#x201c;Dad . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. McDaniels paused long enough to see the other passengers glancing curiously at them. With a snort, he slipped the ads back inside his raincoat as the train came to a temporary stop on the outskirts of the city.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad,&#x201d; Max reassured him. &#x201c;Maybe you could just make her smile a little less toothy.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. McDaniels chuckled and promptly slid his ample bottom across the seat to squish his son. Max elbowed back as more people crowded onto the train, collapsing umbrellas and shaking the wet hair from their eyes.<br><br>Thunder shook the car and the train started to move again. The passengers shrieked and laughed as the cabin went dark. Max squeezed his father&#x2019;s arm, and the train&#x2019;s yellow lights flickered slowly back to life. The rain fell harder now as they neared Chicago, a looming backdrop of steel and brick set in stark relief against the summer storm.<br><br>Max was still grinning when he saw the man.<br><br>He was sitting across the aisle in the row behind them, pale and unkempt, with short black hair still damp from the rain. He appeared exhausted; his eyelids fluttered as he slouched low in his dirty coat and mouthed silent words against the window.<br><br>Max turned away for a moment, swiveling for a better look. He caught his breath.<br><br>The man was staring at him.<br><br>He sat perfectly still as he focused on Max with a startling pair of mismatched eyes. While one eye was green, the other gleamed as wet and white as a peeled egg. Max stared back at it, transfixed. It looked to be a blind, dead thing&#x2014;a thing of nightmares.<br><br>But Max knew somehow that this eye was not blind or dead. He knew he was being studied by it&#x2014;appraised in the way his mother used to examine a glass of wine or an old photograph. Holding Max&#x2019;s gaze, the man eased his head up off the glass and shifted his weight toward the aisle.<br><br>The train entered a tunnel, and the car went dark. A spasm of fear overcame Max. He buried his face in his father&#x2019;s warm coat. Mr. McDaniels grunted and dropped several product brochures onto the floor. The train eased to a stop, and Max heard his father&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;You falling asleep on me, Max? Get your things together&#x2014;we&#x2019;re here, kiddo.&#x201d;<br><br>Max looked up to find the car was light and passengers were shuffling toward the exits. His eyes darted from face to face. The strange man was nowhere to be seen. Flushed, Max gathered his umbrella and sketchbook and hurried out after his father.<br><br>The station was crowded with people milling to and from platforms. Voices droned over loudspeakers; weekend shoppers scurried about with bags and children in tow. Mr. McDaniels steered Max down the escalator toward the exits. The rain had stopped, but the sky was still threatening and newspapers eddied about the street in sudden fits of flight. Arriving at a line of yellow taxis, Mr. McDaniels opened the door to one and stood aside to let Max scoot across the long vinyl seat.<br><br>&#x201c;The Art Institute, please,&#x201d; said his father.<br><br>Max craned his neck, straining to glimpse the tops of the skyscrapers as the cab headed east toward the lake.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; said Max. &#x201c;Did you see that man on the train?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was sitting across the aisle in the row behind us,&#x201d; Max said, shuddering.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; said his father, flicking some lint off his raincoat. &#x201c;What was so special about him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. He was scary-looking and he was staring at me. He looked like he was going to say something or come over right before we went into the tunnel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if he was staring at you, it&#x2019;s probably because you were staring at him,&#x201d; said Mr. McDaniels. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see more kinds of people in the city, Max.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, Dad, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t judge a book by its cover, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, Dad, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, there&#x2019;s this guy at my office. Young kid, still wet behind the ears. Well, my first day I see this kid at the coffee machine with makeup on his eyes, a harpoon through his nose, and music blaring out of his headphones . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Max looked out the taxi&#x2019;s window while his father retold a familiar tale. Finally, Max caught a glimpse of what he had been looking for: two bronze lions standing tall and proud as they flanked the museum entrance.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad, there&#x2019;s the Art Institute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right you are, right you are. Oh, before I forget,&#x201d; Mr. McDaniels said, turning to Max with a sad little smile on his broad face. &#x201c;Thanks for coming with me today, Max. I appreciate it. Your mom appreciates it, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Max offered a solemn nod and gave his dad&#x2019;s hand a fierce squeeze. The McDanielses had always celebrated Bryn McDaniels&#x2019;s birthday with a visit to her favorite museum. Despite his mother&#x2019;s disappearance over two years ago, Max and his father continued the tradition.<br>Once inside, they asked a young woman with a nametag where they could find some of Bryn McDaniels&#x2019;s favorite artists. Max listened as his father rattled off the names from a slip of paper: Picasso, Matisse, and van Gogh came handily enough, but he paused when he came to the last.<br><br>&#x201c;Gaw-gin?&#x201d; he asked, twisting up his face and frowning at the paper.<br><br>&#x201c;Gauguin. He&#x2019;s a wonderful artist. I think you&#x2019;ll enjoy his work.&#x201d; The woman smiled and directed them to a large marble staircase leading to the second floor.<br><br>&#x201c;Your mom sure knows all the names. I&#x2019;ve got no head for this stuff no matter how many times I come here.&#x201d; Mr. McDaniels chuckled and smacked Max on the shoulder with the map.<br><br>The galleries upstairs were filled with color&#x2014;great swirls of paint layered thickly on canvas and board. Mr. McDaniels pointed to a large painting of pedestrians on a rainy Paris street.<br><br>&#x201c;That looks a bit like today, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The rain does, but to look like him you&#x2019;d have to add a mustache and top hat,&#x201d; Max mused, squinting at a figure in the foreground.<br><br>&#x201c;Ugh! I used to have a mustache. Your mother made me shave it when we started dating.&#x201d;<br><br>Some images dominated whole walls, while others nestled in small gilded frames. They spent an hour or so moving from painting to painting, careful to spend extra time at Mrs. McDaniels&#x2019;s favorites. Max particularly liked a Picasso in which a weathered old man cradled a guitar. He was studying the painting when he heard his father exclaim behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;Bob? Bob Lukens! How are you?&#x201d;<br><br>Max turned to see his father pumping the arm of a thin, middle-aged man in a black sweater. A woman accompanied him, and the two were offering hesitant smiles as Mr. McDaniels cornered them.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Scott. Nice to see you,&#x201d; the man said politely. &#x201c;Honey, this is Scott McDaniels. He works on the Bedford Bros. account. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, what a nice surprise. Pleased to meet you, Scott.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll change the way you think about soup!&#x201d; Mr. McDaniels boomed, shooting a finger toward the ceiling.<br><br>Mrs. Lukens gave a start and dropped her purse.<br><br>&#x201c;Imagine a wintry day,&#x201d; Mr. McDaniels continued, bending over to retrieve her things while she retreated a step behind her husband. &#x201c;Your nose is running, the wind is blowing, and all you&#x2019;ve got to warm your tummy is a can of boring old soup in the pantry. Well, no soup is boring with Bedford Bros. Crispy Soup Wafers! Their snappy shapes and crisp crunch will jazz that soup right up and make your taste buds salute!&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. McDaniels raised a hand to his forehead and stood at dutiful attention. Max wanted to go home.<br><br>Mr. Lukens chuckled. &#x201c;Did I mention that Scott&#x2019;s a fanatic, honey?&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Lukens ventured a smile as Mr. McDaniels shook her hand, then turned to Max.<br><br>&#x201c;Max, I&#x2019;d like you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Lukens. Mr. Lukens runs my agency&#x2014;the big boss. Max and I are here to get a shot of culture, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>Max smiled nervously and ex...</p><h2>Roadside Prey</h2><p>Follows the disturbing story of truck driver Robert Ben Rhoades, whose obsession with violent sex prompted him to pick up prostitutes, runaways, and lonely women and torture them to death, a practice that went undetected for fifteen years.

But even those of us who wish we didn't know all those supermodels' names will find this section intriguing. Rossellini also provides some intriguing insights into her often bizarre film roles. There are, though, more bravura sections in this memoir. Who knew that Rossellini still communes with her dead parents? The author prints some of their debates verbatim, though she has already warned: "It's a habit of mine to embellish and color events until I lose sight of what really happened." Rossellini also takes on more upsetting memories such as the painful treatment she underwent for scoliosis and the thoughtless questions people ask about her adopted child.

Now, for the first time, best-selling author Evan Thomas takes us into the courtrooms of William's greatest performances as he defends "Godfather" Frank Costello, Jimmy Hoffa, Frank Sinatra, The Washington Post, and others, as well as behind the scenes where the witnesses are coached, the traps set, and the deals cut. <p>In addition to being a lawyer of unprecedented influence, Williams was also an important Washington insider, privy to the secrets of America's most powerful men. Thomas tells the truth behind the stories that made Williams one of the most talked about public figures of his time, including Williams' role in the publication of the Pentagon Papers and the possibility that Williams may have been Watergate's Deep Throat. Based on Thomas's exclusive access to Williams's papers, "The Man to See" is an unprecedented look at the strategies and influence of this exceptional man.</p><b>Evan Thomas </b>is the author of <i>The Very Best Men: Four Who Dared: The Early Years of the C.I.A.</i>; <i>Robert Kennedy: His Life; The War Lovers: Roosevelt, Lodge, Hearst and the Rush to Empire, 1989</i>; <i>Sea of Thunder: The Last Great Naval Command, 1941-1945</i>; and <i>John Paul Jones. </i>His most recent book is <i>Ike&#x2019;s Bluff: President Eisenhower&#x2019;s Secret Battle to Save the World</i>.</p><h2>HOW IT IS</h2><p>It is one thing to be informed by Shakespeare that life is a tale told by an idiot signifying nothing&#x201d;; it is something else to encounter the idea literally presented in a novel by Samuel Beckett. But I am reasonably certain that a sensitive reader who journeys through How It Is will leave the book convinced that Beckett says more that is relevant to experience in our time than Shakespeare does in Macbeth. It should come as no surprise if a decade or so hence How It Is is appraised as a masterpiece of modern literature.

This is the case for many Americans regarding the question, "Are you saved?" The initial response might be, "Saved from what?" It's a logical reply. Yet too many of us as Christians don't really know how to answer that question--for the ones we are trying to witness to, or for ourselves.</p> <p>R.C. Sproul shows that what we are saved from is really a who--God Himself. That the glory of the gospel is that the One from whom we need to be saved is the very One who saves us. It is when we truly grasp who God is and who we are that we begin to understand the serious demands and joys of repentance.</p> <p>Written for all Christians, Sproul's book uses word studies and biblical insight to challenge readers to fully give their hearts to their Savior.</p></p><p><p><strong>R.

Hailed as one of the most literate and literary writers of our time, in genre and out, Campbell has been acclaimed as a "master of dark fantasy" by Clive Barker, one of today's "finest writers of supernatural horror and psychological suspense" by the Charleston Post &amp; Courier, the "master of a skewed and exquisitely terrifying style" by Library Journal, "one of the world's foremost horror writers" by the San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle, and a "master of mood" by <i>Publishers Weekly</i>. <br><br>In <i>The Darkest Part of the Woods</i>, Campbell introduces readers to the Price family, whose lives have for decades been snarled with the fate of the ancient forest of Goodmanswood. Here, Dr. Lennox Price discovered a hallucinogenic moss that quickly became the focus of a cult-and though the moss and the trees on which it grew are long gone, it seems as if the whole forest can now affect the minds of visitors. <br><br>After Lennox is killed trying to return to his beloved wood, his widow seems to see and hear him in the trees-or is it a dark version of the Green Man that caresses her with leafy hands? Lennox's grandson heeds a call to lie in his lover's arms in the very heart of the forest-and cannot help but wonder what the fruit of that love will be. <br><br>And Heather, Lennox's daughter, who turned her back on her father's mysteries and sought sanctuary in the world of facts and history? Goodmanswood summons her as well . . . <br></p><p>"His stories take place in a world full of threat and insinuation, where even the most contemporary objects shine with a sinister light. The world Ramsey Campbell takes for granted is the world of our darkest nightmares."<br>--Peter Straub<br><br>"Ramsey Campbell writes quiet, precise, grim psychological novels--literary cousins of M. C. Escher's disturbing mathematical images. Campbell writes vividly and convincingly about the existence of evil. He continues to break new ground, advancing the style and thematic content of horror fiction far beyond the works of his contemporaries."<br>--<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>"Ramsey Campbell distills the sort of pure quiet terror few other writers even know exists. Like Stephen King at his very best, Campbell plumbs the depths of what humans can do to each other. A terrifying, ferocious, and deeply compassionate book."<br>--Sarah Smith, author of <i>The Knowledge of Water </i>and <i>The Vanished Child</i><br><br>"Campbell continues to produce fiction that astonishes, unsettles, and-in its deeply perverse fashion-delights. No one is better than Campbell at creating-and maintaining-a sense of nebulous, impending doom. Pact of the Fathers is the clear product of a master craftsman with a grim, unflinching vision of the world and of our precarious positions in it. Like the best contemporary horror fiction, Pact of the Fathers is exhilarating and unsettling in equal measure, and leaves a lingering aftertaste behind."<br>-<i>Locus</i><br><br>"Ramsey Campbell is highly regarded for his sensitive use of the language and his ability to create psychologically complex characters."<br>--Dean Koontz<br>Ramsey Campbell has won more awards than any other living author of horror or dark fantasy, including four World Fantasy Awards, nine British Fantasy Awards, three Bram Stoker Awards, and two International Horror Guild Awards. Critically acclaimed both in the US and in England, Campbell is widely regarded as one of the genre's literary lights for both his short fiction and his novels.

From the mummified remains of its first known victim to the sinister threat of the "frozen monster" that lurks in the vials of ultramodern laboratories, readers will be held spellbound by this readable and timely combination of science and history.</p><p><b>Albert Marrin</b> is a much-decorated historian and writer whose most recent book, <b>Terror of the Spanish Main</b>, was called "addictive reading" in <b>The Horn Book</b>. He lives in Riverdale, New York.Grade 5-9-This is a fascinating, detailed history of the smallpox virus, beginning with its probable origins in a farm animal in Asia or the Middle East approximately 8000 years ago, continuing with its spread to Europe via trade routes, to the New World with the Spanish explorers, and concluding with the current concern that remaining stocks of variola may fall into the hands of terrorists intent on waging germ warfare. Intertwined with the disease's history is the biography of Edward Jenner, the 18th-century English surgeon whose observation that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox were immune to smallpox led him to conduct experiments that resulted in the perfection of the smallpox vaccination. Jenner is portrayed as a dedicated doctor devoted to what he considered a sacred mission, that of completely annihilating the "Speckled Monster" and demonstrating that science could ultimately triumph over disease. His dream appeared to have come true when the World Health Organization declared in 1980 that smallpox had been eradicated from Earth, but the continued existence in the U.S. and Russia of some 600 vials of frozen variola, originally slated to be destroyed by December 31, 1993, is at the center of an ongoing controversy among scientists, governments, and the military.

Kenya, generally regarded as the cradle of mankind, is a land of contrasts, with famous game reserves, stunning landscapes, and a vibrant cultural tradition. It also provides plenty to worry a traveller like Bill Bryson, fixated as he is on the dangers posed by snakes, insects and large predators. But on a more sober note, it is a country that shares many serious human and environmental problems with the rest of Africa: refugees, AIDS, drought and grinding poverty. Travelling around the country, Bryson casts his inimitable eye on a continent new to him, and the resultant diary, though short in length, contains the trademark Bryson stamp of wry observation and curious insight. All the author&#39;s royalties from &#34;Bill Bryson&#39;s African Diary&#34;, as well as all profits, will go to CARE International.</p><p>"Here is a man who suffers so his readers can laugh." -- "Daily Telegraph <br>Bill Bryson travels to Kenya in support of CARE International.

While flower sellers, costermongers, shopkeepers, and hansom drivers ply their trades, the London police watch over all. Or so people believe. . . .<br><br>Early one morning, Thomas Pitt, dauntless mainstay of the Special Branch, is summoned to Long Spoon Lane, where anarchists are plotting an attack. Bombs explode, destroying the homes of many poor people. After a chase, two of the culprits are captured and the leader is shot . . . but by whom?<br><br>As Pitt delves into the case, he finds that there is more to the terrorism than the destructive gestures of misguided idealists. The police are running a lucrative protection racket, and clues suggest that Inspector Wetron of Bow Street is the mastermind. As the shadowy leader of the Inner Circle, Wetron is using his influence with the press to whip up fears of more attacks&#x2013;and to rush a bill through Parliament that would severely curtail civil liberties. This would make him the most powerful man in the country.<br><br>To defeat Wetron, Pitt finds that he must run in harness with his old enemy, Sir Charles Voisey, and the unlikely allies are joined by Pitt&#x2019;s clever wife, Charlotte, and her great aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould. Can they prevail? As they strive to prevent future destruction, nothing less than the fate of the British Empire hangs in precarious balance.<br><br>From the first sentence to the last, <i>Long Spoon Lane</i> is a miracle of suspense, of plot and counterplot, bluff and counterbluff, in a take-no-prisoners battle between good and evil. It is possibly the very best of all the wonderful Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels.</p><p><b>ANNE PERRY</b> is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including <i>Southampton Row</i> and <i>Seven Dials, </i>and the William Monk novels, most recently <i>Death of a Stranger</i> and <i>The Shifting Tide.</i> Her novels<i> No Graves As Yet </i>and <i>Shoulder the Sky</i> launched a five-book miniseries about World War I.

Victor Narraway, his companion, swore. Pitt regained his balance as they gathered speed towards Aldgate and Whitechapel High Street. The horse&#x2019;s hooves struck hard on the cobbles and ahead of them traffic was scattering out of the way. Thank heaven this early there was little enough of it: a few costermongers&#x2019; carts with fruit and vegetables, a brewer&#x2019;s dray, goods wagons, and one horse-drawn omnibus.<br><br>&#x201c;Right!&#x201d; Narraway shouted at the driver. &#x201c;Commercial Road! It&#x2019;s faster!&#x201d;<br><br>The driver obeyed without answering. It was fifteen minutes before six on a summer morning and there were already laborers, hawkers, tradesmen, and domestic servants about. Please heaven they would be in Myrdle Street before six o&#x2019;clock!<br><br>Pitt felt as if his heart were beating in his throat. The call had come just over half an hour ago, but it felt like an eternity. The telephone had woken him and he had gone racing downstairs in his nightshirt. Narraway&#x2019;s voice had been crackly and breathless on the other end. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve sent a cab for you. Meet me on Cornhill, north side, outside the Royal Exchange. Immediately. Anarchists are going to bomb a house on Myrdle Street.&#x201d; Then he had hung up without waiting for a reply, leaving Pitt to go back upstairs and tell Charlotte before he scrambled into his clothes. She had run downstairs and fetched him a glass of milk and a slice of bread, but there had been no time for tea.<br><br>He had stood a cold, impatient five minutes on the pavement outside the Royal Exchange until Narraway&#x2019;s cab arrived and slithered to a halt. Then the driver&#x2019;s long whip snaked out and urged the horse forward again even before Pitt had fallen into the other seat.<br><br>Now they were charging towards Myrdle Street and he still had very little idea what it was about, except that the information had come from Narraway&#x2019;s own sources on the fringes of the seething East End underworld&#x2014;the province of cracksmen, macers, screevers, footpads, and the swarming thieves of every kind that preyed on the river.<br><br>&#x201c;Why Myrdle Street?&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could be anyone,&#x201d; Narraway replied without taking his eyes off the road. Special Branch had been created originally to deal with Irish Fenians in London, but now they dealt with all threats to the safety of the country. Just at the moment&#x2014;early summer 1893&#x2014;the danger at the front of most people&#x2019;s minds was anarchist bombers. There had been several incidents in Paris, and London had suffered half a dozen explosions of one degree or another.<br><br>Narraway had no idea whether this latest threat came from the Irish, who were still pursuing Home Rule, or revolutionaries simply desiring to overthrow the government, the throne, or law and order in general.<br><br>They swung left around the corner up into Myrdle Street, across the junction, and stopped. Just up ahead the police were busy waking people up, hurrying them out of their homes and into the road. There was no time to look for treasured possessions, not even to grasp onto more than a coat or a shawl against the cool air of the morning.<br><br>Pitt saw a constable of about twenty chivvying along an old woman. Her white hair hung in thin wisps over her shoulders, her arthritic feet bare on the cobbles. Suddenly he almost choked with fury against whoever was doing this.<br><br>A small boy wandered across the street, blinking in bewilderment, dragging a mongrel puppy on a length of string.<br><br>Narraway was out of the cab and striding towards the nearest constable, Pitt on his heels. The constable swiveled around to tell him to go back, his face flushed with anxiety and annoyance. &#x201c;Yer gotta get out o&#x2019; the way, sir.&#x201d; He waved his arm. &#x201c;Well back, sir. There&#x2019;s a bomb in one o&#x2019; . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know!&#x201d; Narraway said smartly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Victor Narraway, head of Special Branch. This is my associate, Thomas Pitt. Do you know where the bomb is?&#x201d;<br><br>The constable stood half to attention, still holding his right hand out to bar people from returning to their homes in the still, almost breathless morning air. &#x201c;No sir,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Not to be exact. We reckon it&#x2019;s gotter be one o&#x2019; them two over there.&#x201d; He inclined his head towards the opposite side of the street. Narrow, three-story houses huddled together, doors wide open, front steps whitened by proud, hardworking women. A cat wandered out of one of them, and a child shouted to it eagerly and it ran towards her.<br><br>&#x201c;Is everyone out?&#x201d; Narraway demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, far as we can tell&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The rest of his answer was cut off by a shattering explosion. It came at first like a sharp crack, and then a roar and a tearing and crumbling. A huge chunk of one of the houses lifted in the air then blew apart. Rubble fell crashing into the street and over other roofs, smashing slates and toppling chimneys. Dust and flames filled the air. People were shouting hysterically. Someone was screaming.<br><br>The constable was shouting too, his mouth wide open, but his words were lost in the noise. His body staggered oddly as if his legs would not obey him. He lurched forward, waving his arms as people stood rooted to the ground in horror.<br><br>Another blast roared somewhere inside the second house. The walls shivered and seemed to subside upon themselves, bricks and plaster falling outward. Then there was more flame, black smoke gushing up.<br><br>Suddenly people started to run. Children were sobbing, someone was cursing loudly, and several dogs burst into frenzied barking. An old man was swearing steadily at everything he could think of, repeating himself over and over.<br><br>Narraway&#x2019;s face was white, his black eyes like holes in his head. They had never expected to be able to prevent the bombs going off, but it was still a searing defeat to see such wreckage strewn across the road, and terrified and bewildered people stumbling around. The flames were getting hold of the dry lath and timber and beginning to spread.<br><br>A fire engine pulled up, its horses sweating, their eyes rolling. Men leapt out and started to uncoil the big, canvas hoses, but it was going to be a hopeless task.<br><br>Pitt felt a stunning sense of failure. Special Branch was for preventing things like this. And now that it had happened there was nothing comforting or purposeful he could do. He did not even know if there would be a third bomb, or a fourth.<br><br>Another constable came sprinting along the street, arms waving wildly, his helmet jammed crookedly on his head. &#x201c;Other side!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re getting away on the other side!&#x201d;<br><br>It was a moment before Pitt realized what he meant.<br><br>Narraway knew immediately. He twisted on his heel and started back towards the hansom.<br><br>Pitt galvanized into action, catching up with Narraway just as he swung up into the cab, barking at the driver to go back to Fordham Street and turn east.<br><br>The man obeyed instantly, snaking the long carriage whip over the horse&#x2019;s back and urging it forward. They went to the left, crossed Essex Street barely hesitating, and glimpsed another hansom disappearing north up New Road towards Whitechapel.<br><br>&#x201c;After them!&#x201d; Narraway shouted, ignoring the morning traffic of delivery carts and drays, which swerved out of their way and jammed together.<br><br>There had been no time to ask who the bombers might be, but as they slewed around the corner into Whitechapel Road, and past the London Hospital, Pitt turned his mind to it. The anarchist threats so far had been disorganized and no specific demands had been made. London was the capital of an empire that stretched across almost every continent on the earth, and the islands between, and it was also the biggest port in the world. There was a constant influx of every nationality under the sun&#x2014;recently in particular immigrants had arrived from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, seeking to escape the power of the tsar. Others from Spain and Italy, and especially France, had more socialist aims in mind.<br><br>Beside him Narraway was craning forward, his lean body rigid. His face turned first one way then the other as he sought to catch a glimpse of the hansom ahead. Whitechapel had turned into Mile End Road. They passed the huge block of Charrington&#x2019;s Brewery on the left.<br><br>&#x201c;It makes no damn sense!&#x201d; he said bitterly.<br><br>The cab ahead of them turned left up Peters Street. It had barely straightened when it disappeared to the right into Willow Place and then Long Spoon Lane. Pitt and Narraway&#x2019;s cab overshot and had to turn and double back. By that time there were two more cabs slithering to a halt with policemen piling out of them, and the original cab had gone.<br><br>Long Spoon Lane was narrow and cobbled. Its gray tenement buildings rose up sheer for three stories, grimy, stained with the smoke and damp of generations. The air smelled of wet rot and old sewage.<br><br>Pitt glanced along both sides, east and west. Several doorways were boarded up. A large woman stood blocking another, hands on her hips, glaring at the disturbance to her routine. To the west one door slammed, but when two constables charged with their shoulders to it, it did not budge. They tried again and again with no effect.<br><br>&#x201c;It must be barricaded,&#x201d; Narraway said grimly. &#x201c;Get back!&#x201d; he ordered the men.<br><br>Pitt felt a chill. Narraway must fear the anarchists were armed. It was absurd. Less than two hours ago he had been lying in bed half-asleep, Charlotte&#x2019;s hair a dark river across the pillow beside him. The early sunlight had made a bright bar between the curtains, and busy sparrows chattered in the trees outside. Now he stood shivering as he stared up at the ugly wall of a tenement building...</p><h2>24/7: A One Year Chronological Bible</h2><p>This daily reading Bible is the story of how God reached into the world, in the order the events happened.

F&#x201d;lsing (head of science for the North German Radio/Television Network) recognizes that Albert Einstein (18791955) was a complex man whose importance went far beyond his enormous contributions to science. However, as the author (himself a physicist by training) points out, physics was Einstein's ``passion and his life,'' and many of the other events of his life--his involvement in politics, his celebrity status, his efforts on behalf of the Jewish people- -were more in the nature of distractions from his true calling. So while the present volume does not skimp in its treatment of Einstein's life outside science, physics provides the central focus--and, unfortunately, its central weakness. Readers without considerable scientific background may feel that F&#x201d;lsing fails to adequately explain many of the central questions to which Einstein addressed himself. On the other hand, F&#x201d;lsing offers a fascinating picture of the life of a scientist in the first half of this century. Einstein's school career, his job at the Swiss patent office, his movement into the academic world (and the political maneuvers this involved), and his acceptance by the international scientific community are covered in marvelous detail. Einstein's private life has been the subject of some controversy; however, despite having access to many previously unpublished letters, F&#x201d;lsing has little to contribute to such questions as whether Einstein's first wife, Mileva, had any substantial input into the theory of relativity. Einstein's later years, from the accession of Hitler in 1933 to the scientist's death, are given remarkably short shrift. The translation, with numerous muddy patches and unidiomatic translations, often falls short of clarity. While it sheds interesting light on many aspects of Einstein's life, this biography will be of more interest to the specialist than to the general reader. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Today I became 15 years old.... Must I day in day out see the walled-up ghetto gate, must I in my best years see only the one little street, the few stuffy courtyards?... I wish to shout to time to linger, not to run. I wish to recapture my past year and keep it for later, for the new life."&#x2014;from the diary of Yitskhok Rudashevski, Vilna ghetto, Lithuania, December 10, 1942; he was killed in 1943</p><h2>The Language God Talks: On Science and Religion</h2><p>&#34;More years ago than I care to reckon up, I met Richard Feynman.&#34; So begins THE LANGUAGE GOD TALKS, Herman Wouk&#39;s gem on navigating the divide between science and religion. In one rich, compact volume, Wouk draws on stories from his life as well as on key events from the 20th century to address the eternal questions of why we are here, what purpose faith serves, and how scientific fact fits into the picture. He relates wonderful conversations he&#39;s had with scientists such as Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann, Freeman Dyson, and Steven Weinberg, and brings to life such pivotal moments as the 1969 moon landing and the Challenger disaster. Brilliantly written, THE LANGUAGE GOD TALKS is a scintillating and lively investigation and a worthy addition to the literature.</p><p>Herman Wouk's<strong> </strong>acclaimed<strong> </strong>books include <i>The Will to Live On</i>, <i>This Is My God</i>, Pulitzer Prize winner <em>The Caine Mutiny</em>, <em>The Winds of War</em>, and <em>War and Remembrance</em>.Herman Wouk, best known for his fiction, in particular THE WINDS OF WAR, invokes a theme he summarizes with the question, &#34;Is the stage too big for the drama?&#34; Thus, he tantalizes listeners to continue with his thought-provoking journey from quantum theory to religion. During an interview with Richard Feynman, the self-professed agnostic and architect of the atomic bomb tells Wouk that &#34;calculus is the language God talks.&#34; The brain food in this audiobook weighs so much that narrator Bob Walter must shift to low gear to allow listeners to absorb every morsel. Walter sounds comfortable with the vast vocabulary of science mixed with sprinklings of Yiddish. In the coda he credibly personifies a Jewish scholar from Wouk&#39;s WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, delivering a touching eulogy prior to his murder in the Holocaust.

If so, you must read this book. In it Vicki Hearne asserts that animals that interact with humans are more intelligent than we assume. In fact, they are capable of developing an understanding of &#x201c;the good,&#x201d; a moral code that influences their motives and actions. Hearne&#x2019;s thorough studies led her to adopt a new system of animal training that contradicts modern animal behavioral research, but&#x2014;as her examples show&#x2014;is astonishingly effective. Hearne&#x2019;s theories will make every trainer, animal psychologist, and animal-lover stop, think, and question.</p><p>From &#34;AUDUBON MAGAZINE,&#34; which chose it as one of the thirteen most significant books about nature publishing during the last hundred yers, to Susan Sontag, who hailed it as a &#34;fascinating, incisive work of moral imagination,&#34; admirers of &#34;Adam&#39;s Task&#34; have praised it is one of our era&#39;s most original and brilliant books about language, domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses), and ourselves. Drawing on the discourses of philosophy and animal training, Vicki Hearne makes a case, in boldly anthromorphic terms, for attributing to the creatures we love, train, and play with, the potential for a &#34;moral understanding&#34; of their relationship to us--the potential, in other words, for nobility and dignity. With a new introduction by Donald McCaig.<i>Adam's Task</i> offers an innovative and metaphysical approach to training animals. Based on studies of literary criticism, philosophy, and extensive hands-on experience in training, Hearne asserts that animals (at least those that commonly cohabitate or interact with humans) are far more intelligent than we assume. In fact, they are capable of developing an understanding of "the good," a moral code that influences their motives and actions. In response to her studies and experiments, Hearne developed an entirely new system of animal training that contradicts modern animal behavioral research and yet, as her examples show, is astonishingly effective.</p><h2>Light Action in the Caribbean: Stories</h2><p>Moving from fable and historical fiction to contemporary realism, this book of stories from Barry Lopez is erotic and wise, full of irresistible characters doing things they shouldn't do for reasons that are mysterious and irreducible. In "The Letters of Heaven," a packet of recently discovered 17th-century Peruvian love letters presents a 20th-century man with the paralyzing choice of either protecting or exposing their stunning secret. When some young boys on the lookout for easy money get caught with a truckload of stolen horses, thievery quickly turns into redemption. For a group of convicts, a gathering of birds in the prison yard may be the key to transcendence, both figurative and literal. And, with the title story, Lopez enters a territory of unmitigated evil reminiscent of Conrad. Here are saints who shouldn't touch, but do; sinners who insist on the life of the spirit; a postcard paradise that turns into nightmare.<br><br><b>Light Action in the Caribbean</b> has already been hailed by Russell Banks as "tough-minded, emotionally turbulent, and always intelligent." E. Annie Proulx describes these stories as "subtle and mysterious" and says that a reader "cannot leave Lopez's fictional territory unchanged." This is a book that breaks exciting new ground for Barry Lopez.</p><p>A reader can never know for certain how Barry Lopez constructs his stories. But they read as though their author first came up with some utterly compelling image, and the story fit itself around the image. Fans of the author's nature writing in <i>Crossing Open Ground</i> and <i>Arctic Dreams</i> will be pleased to find that often these images express human devotion to the land. In a kind of fantasy piece titled "In the Great Bend of the Souris River," a horseman, adrift in the countryside in North Dakota, encounters two other riders who "could be Cree." The three men ride across the prairie together. "I knew these people no better than two deer I might have stumbled upon, but I was comfortable with them, and the way we fit against the prairie satisfied me. I felt I could ride a very long way like this, absorbed by whatever it was we now shared, a kind of residency." In "Remembering Orchards," a character recalls with regret his orchardist stepfather whom he wishes he'd known better and who died "contorted in his bed like a root mass." <p> Lopez introduces other, more disturbing images here as well, perhaps most notably in the title story, wherein a woman travels with her boyfriend to a diving resort in the Caribbean. In a weird twist on J.D. Salinger's "A Perfect Day for Bananafish," the trip ends in brutal bloodshed, which Lopez describes in chillingly affectless prose. The story contains this stunner of a sentence: "The first bullet tore through his left triceps, the second, third, fourth, and fifth hit nothing, the sixth perforated his spleen, the seventh and eighth hit nothing, the ninth hit the console, sending electrical sparks up, the tenth went through his right palm, the next four went into the air, the fifteenth tore his left ear away, the sixteenth ricocheted off the sixth cervical vertebra and drove down through his heart, exiting through his abdomen and lodging in his foot." There's no escape from Lopez's images; they come after us. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"This is a collection of subtle and mysterious stories, maps of an animistic world where travelers move beyond the reality of the senses toward spiritual recognition. The reader cannot leave Lopez's fictional territory unchanged."<br>-- Annie Proulx<br><br>Barry Lopez's short stories are superb.

Set to retire, he instead accepted what he thought was a final mission&#x2015;this time not to win a war, but to stop one. Across the Pacific, conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists threatened to suck in the United States and escalate into revolution. His assignment was to broker a peace, build a Chinese democracy, and prevent a Communist takeover, all while staving off World War III.</p><p>In his thirteen months in China, Marshall journeyed across battle-scarred landscapes, grappled with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and plotted and argued with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his brilliant wife, often over card games or cocktails. The results at first seemed miraculous. But as they started to come apart, Marshall was faced with a wrenching choice. Its consequences would define the rest of his career, as the secretary of state who launched the Marshall Plan and set the standard for American leadership, and the shape of the Cold War and the US-China relationship for decades to come. It would also help spark one of the darkest turns in American civic life, as Marshall and the mission became a first prominent target of McCarthyism, and the question of &#x201c;who lost China&#x201d; roiled American politics.</p><p><em>The China Mission</em> traces this neglected turning point and forgotten interlude in a heroic career&#x2015;a story of not just diplomatic wrangling and guerrilla warfare, but also intricate spycraft and charismatic personalities. Drawing on eyewitness accounts both personal and official, it offers a richly detailed, gripping, close-up, and often surprising view of the central figures of the time&#x2015;from Marshall, Mao, and Chiang to Eisenhower, Truman, and MacArthur&#x2015;as they stood face-to-face and struggled to make history, with consequences and lessons that echo today.</p></p><p><strong>Daniel Kurtz-Phelan</strong> is the executive editor of <em>Foreign Affairs</em>.

The lessons from what he calls the &#x2018;unsettled world&#x2019; of the early Cold War are urgently relevant today. <em>The China Mission</em> will be read for years to come as a window on the origins of American power&#x2015;and the limits of its reach.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Evan Osnos, <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer and author of <em>Age of Ambition</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Was America&#x2019;s greatest statesman to blame for America&#x2019;s greatest diplomatic failure?

Besides the traditional use of mushrooms to enhance meat and vegetable dishes, edible fungi may be cooked in vine leaves, made into p�t�, powdered, pur�ed into mushroom ketchup, baked into a flan (an Alice B. Toklas specialty), baked as a cake with cream sauce, and used in many other dishes that are too intriguing to resist. Grigson also explains the differences between good and poisonous mushrooms, relates some folk stories behind the recipes, and gives a history of mushroom cultivation that doesn&#39;t leave you in the dark about friendly fungi.Truffles&#x2026;shiitakes&#x2026;morels &#x2013; mushrooms conjure visions of one of the most intriguing and subtle of all comestibles. The average cook can be mystified by how best to prepare these gastronomic treats, while epicures hunger for new ways to expand their repertoires. Jane Grigson presents more than 250 mushroom recipes &#x2013; from simple to highly sophisticated &#x2013; for soups, sauces, stuffings, main courses, and more that will satisfy the curiosity and appetites of mushroom dabblers and diehards alike. Included are helpful tips for selecting and preserving the best edible mushrooms (both wild and cultivated), the folklore behind the recipes, a brief history of mushroom cultivation, guides to distinguish edible from poisonous fungi for those who venture to pick their own, and charming line drawings of the twenty-one most common species. While poet W. H. Auden immortalized &#x201c;dear Jane Grigson&#x201d; in The Entertainment of the Senses, Grigson, an artiest in her trade, is best known for her own wonderful books on food. The Mushroom Feast is an indispensable classic for all those who love mushrooms as much as this rare find: a fine, timeless, literary cookbook.

Steiner teaches that, without love, nothing is possible; with love, however, we can do everything. Love is always "love of the not-yet." To love is to create; it is to selflessly enter the current of time that flows toward us from the future. <br><br>Reality, true knowledge of reality, is impossible without love. Only through love can we truly know as we are know, can we encounter the world and its beings in a living way. Without love, knowledge becomes manipulation, domination, control; the world becomes a space of dead things. But, when we know through love, we enter into a pattern of dynamic, potentially redemptive relations and the world becomes a living world of beings working for the good. <br><br>This collection gathers all of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s main lectures and writings related to love. From earthly love to the nature and function of spiritual love, these pieces are essential reading for anyone concerned with the future of humanity and the Earth. <br><br><b><i>Love and Its Meaning in the World</i></b> is essential reading for anyone who'd like to gain a deeper understanding of our true mission as human beings and the purpose of evolution on Earth. <br><br><b>Chapters include</b>: <br><ul> <li> "The Division of the Sexes"</li> <li> "Lucifer and Christ"</li> <li> "The Mission of Reverence"</li> <li> "The Buddha's Teaching of Compassion and Love"</li> <li> "Faith, Love, and Hope"</li> <li> "Love &amp; Its Meaning in the World"</li> <li> "'I'-Feeling, the Soul's Capacity to Love, and Their Relationship to the Elemental World"</li> </ul><br><br>Love mediated by the senses is the wellspring of creative power, of what is coming into being. Without sense-born love, nothing material would exist in the world; without spiritual love, nothing spiritual can arise in evolution. When we practice love, cultivate love, creative forces pour into the world.... <br><br>For human beings, love is the most important fruit of experience in the sensory world. Once we really understand the nature of love, or compassion, we will find that love is the way spirit expresses its truth in the world of the senses.... <br><br>"We may even say that, in love, the spiritual world awakens in the physical. The more truly a soul inhabits the spiritual worlds, the more it experiences lovelessness and lack of compassion as a denial of spirit itself." &#x2015;<b>Rudolf Steiner</b></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders</h2><p>Warren E.

Guy Carson and Susana Cabeza de Vaca have come to Mount Dragon to work shoulder to shoulder with some of the greatest scientific minds on the planet. Led by visionary genius Brent Scopes, their secret goal is a medical breakthrough that promises to bring incalculable benefits to the human race. But while Scopes believes he is leading the way to a new world order, he may in fact be opening the door to mass human extinction. And when Guy and Susana attempt to stop him they find themselves locked in a frightening battle with Scopes, his henchmen, and the apocalyptic nightmare that science has unleashed .<br> <br>Special lower priced edition available for a limited time.<br><br></p><p>DOUGLAS PRESTON has worked for the American Museum of Natural History as well as being a contributor to <i>The New Yorker.</i> He is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Codex</i> and <i>Tyrannosaur Canyon.</i> <i>Relic</i> was the first book in his many <i>New York Times</i> bestselling collaborations with Lincoln Child, including <i>Dance of Death,</i> <i>Brimstone, The Cabinet of Curiosities,</i> and <i>Still Life with Crows</i>.

He lives with his wife and daughter in Morristown, New Jersey.<br>Guy Carson, stuck at yet another traffic light, glanced at the clock on his dashboard. He was already late for work, second time this week. Ahead, U.S. Route 1 ran like a bad dream through Edison, New Jersey. The light turned green, but by the time he had edged up it was red again.<br>&#x201c;Son of a <i>bitch</i>&#x201d; he muttered, slamming the dashboard with the fat part of his palm. He watched as the rain splattered across the windshield, listened to the slap and whine of the wipers. The serried ranks of brake lights rippled back toward him as the traffic slowed yet again. He knew he&#x2019;d never get used to this congestion any more than he&#x2019;d get used to all the damn rain.<br>Creeping painfully over a rise, Carson could see, a mere half mile down the highway, the crisp white facade of the GeneDyne Edison complex, a postmodern masterpiece rising above green lawns and artificial ponds. Somewhere inside, Fred Peck lay in wait.<br>Carson turned on the radio, and the throbbing sound of the Gangsta Muthas filled the air. As he fiddled with the dial, Michael Jackson&#x2019;s shrill voice separated itself from the static. Carson punched it off in disgust. Some things were even worse than the thought of Peck. Why couldn&#x2019;t they have a decent country station in this hole?<br>* * *<br>The lab was bustling when he arrived, Peck nowhere in sight. Carson drew the lab coat over his lanky frame and sat down at his terminal, knowing his log-on time would automatically go into his personnel file. If by some miracle Peck was out sick, he&#x2019;d be sure to notice when he came in. Unless he had died, of course. Now, that was something to think about. The man did look like a walking heart attack.<br>&#x201c;Ah, Mr. Carson,&#x201d; came the mocking voice behind him. &#x201c;How kind of you to grace us with your presence this morning.&#x201d; Carson closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then turned around.<br>The soft form of his supervisor was haloed by the fluorescent light. Peck&#x2019;s brown tie still bore testament to that morning&#x2019;s scrambled eggs, and his generous jowls were mottled with razor burn. Carson exhaled through his nose, fighting a losing battle with the heavy aroma of Old Spice.<br>It had been a shock on Carson&#x2019;s first day at GeneDyne, one of the world&#x2019;s premier biotechnology companies, to find a man like Fred Peck there waiting for him. In the eighteen months since, Peck had gone out of his way to keep Carson busy with menial lab work. Carson guessed it had something to do with Peck&#x2019;s lowly M.S. from Syracuse University and his own Ph.D. from MIT. Or maybe Peck just didn&#x2019;t like Southwestern hicks.<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; he said with what he hoped would pass for sincerity. &#x201c;Got caught in traffic.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Traffic,&#x201d; said Peck, as if the word was new to him.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Carson, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ve been rerouting&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Re<i>routin</i>&#x2019;,&#x201d; Peck repeated, imitating Carson&#x2019;s Western twang.<br>&#x201c;&#x2014;detouring, I mean, the traffic from the Jersey Turn-pike&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, the <i>Turnpike</i>,&#x201d; Peck said.<br>Carson fell silent.<br>Peck cleared his throat. &#x201c;traffic in New Jersey at rush hour. What an unexpected shock it must have been for you, Carson.&#x201d; He crossed his arms. &#x201c;You almost missed your meeting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Meeting?&#x201d; Carson said. &#x201c;What meeting? I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course you didn&#x2019;t know. I just heard about it myself. That&#x2019;s one of the many reasons you have to be here on time, Carson.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Peck,&#x201d; Carson said, getting up and following Peck past a maze of identical cubicles. Mr. Fred Peckerwood. Sir Frederick Peckerfat. He was itching to deck the oily bastard. But that wasn&#x2019;t the way they did business around here. If Peck had been a ranch boss, the man would&#x2019;ve been on his ass in the dirt long ago.<br>Peck opened a door marked videoconferencing room ii and waved Carson inside. It was only as Carson looked around the large, empty table within that he realized he was still wearing his filthy lab coat.<br>&#x201c;Take a seat,&#x201d; Peck said.<br>&#x201c;Where is everybody?&#x201d; Carson asked.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just you,&#x201d; Peck replied. He started to back out the door.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not staying?&#x201d; Carson felt a rising uncertainty, wondering if he&#x2019;d missed an important piece of e-mail, if he should have prepared something. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Peck replied. &#x201c;Carson, when you&#x2019;re finished here, come straight down to my office. We need to talk about your attitude.&#x201d;<br>The door shut with the solid click of oak engaging steel. Carson gingerly took a seat at the cherrywood table and looked around. It was a beautiful room, finished in hand-rubbed blond wood. A wall of windows looked out over the meadows and ponds of the GeneDyne complex. Beyond lay endless urban waste. Carson tried to compose himself for whatever ordeal was coming. Probably Peck had sent in enough negative ratings on him to merit a stem lecture from personnel, or worse.<br>In a way, he supposed, Peck was right his attitude could certainly be improved. He had to rid himself of the stubborn bad-ass outlook that did in his father. Carson would never forget that day on the ranch when his father sucker-punched a banker. That incident had been the start of the foreclosure proceedings. His father had been his own worst enemy, and Carson was determined not to repeat his mistakes. There were a lot of Pecks in the world.<br>But it was a goddamn shame, the way the last year and a half of his life had been flushed virtually down the toilet. When he was first offered the job at GeneDyne, it had seemed the pivotal moment of his life, the one thing he&#x2019;d left home and worked so hard for. And still, more than anything, GeneDyne stood out as one place where he could really make a difference, maybe do something important. But each day that he woke up in hateful Jersey&#x2014;to the cramped, unfamiliar apartment, the gray industrial sky, and Peck&#x2014;it seemed less and less likely.<br>The lights of the conference room dimmed and went out. Window shades were automatically drawn, and a large panel slid back from the wall, revealing a bank of keyboards and a large video-projection screen.<br>The screen flickered on, and a face swam into focus. Carson froze. There they were: the jug ears, the sandy hair, the unrepentant cowlick, the thick glasses, the trademark black T-shirt, the sleepy, cynical expression. All the features that together made up the face of Brentwood Scopes, founder of GeneDyne. The <i>Time</i> issue with the cover article on Scopes still lay next to Carson&#x2019;s living-room couch. The CEO who ruled his company from cyberspace. Lionized on Wall Street, worshipped by his employees, feared by his rivals. What was this, some kind of motivational film for hard cases?<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; said the image of Scopes. &#x201c;How&#x2019;re you doing, Guy?&#x201d;<br>For a moment Carson was speechless. <i>Jesus</i>, he thought, <i>this isn&#x2019;t a film at all</i>. &#x201c;Uh, hello, Mr. Scopes. Sir. Fine. Sorry, I&#x2019;m not really dressed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Please call me Brent. And face the screen when you talk. I can see you better that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not sir. Brent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right. Thanks, Brent.&#x201d; Just calling the supreme leader of GeneDyne by his first name was painfully difficult.<br>&#x201c;I like to think of my employees as colleagues,&#x201d; Scopes said. &#x201c;After all, when you joined the company, you became a principal in the business, like everyone else. You own stock in this company, which means we all rise and fall together.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Brent.&#x201d; In the background, behind the image of Scopes, Carson could make out the dim outlines of what looked like a massive, many-sided vault.<br>Scopes smiled, as if unashamedly pleased at the sound of his name, and as he smiled it seemed to Carson that he looked almost like a teenager, despite being thirty-nine. He watched Scopes&#x2019;s image with a growing sense of unreality. Why would Scopes, the boy genius, the man who built a four-billion-dollar company out of a few kernels of ancient corn, want to talk to him? <i>Shit, I must have screwed up worse than I thought</i>.<br>Scopes glanced down for a moment, and Carson could hear the tapping of keys. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking into your background, Guy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Very impressive. I can see why we hired you.&#x201d; More tapping. &#x201c;Although I can&#x2019;t quite understand why you&#x2019;re working as, let&#x2019;s see, a Lab Technician Three.&#x201d;<br>Scopes looked up again. &#x201c;Guy, you&#x2019;ll forgive me if I get right to the point. There&#x2019;s an important post in this company that&#x2019;s currently vacant. 1 think you&#x2019;re the person for it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Carson blurted, instantly regretting his own excitement.<br>Scopes smiled again. &#x201c;I wish I could give you specifics, but it&#x2019;s a highly confidential project. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll understand if 1 only describe the assignment in general terms.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do I look like a &#x2018;sir&#x2019; to you, Guy? It wasn&#x2019;t so long ago that I was just the nerdy kid being picked on in the schoolyard. What I <i>can</i> tell you is that this assignment involves the most important product GeneDyne has ever produced. One that will be of incalculable value to the human race.&#x201d;<br>Scopes saw the look on Carson&#x2019;s face and grinned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;when you can help people and get rich at the same time.&#x201d; He brought his face closer to the camera. &#x201c;What we&#x2019;re offering you is a six-month reassignment to the GeneDyne Remote Desert Testing Facility. The Mount Dragon laboratory. You&#x2019;ll be working with a small, dedicated team, the best microbiologists in the company.&#x201d;<br>Carson felt a surge of excitement. Just the words <i>Mount Dragon</i> were like a magic talisman throughout all of GeneDyne: a scientific Shangri-la.<br>A pizza box was laid at Scopes&#x2019;s elbow by someone offscreen. He glanced at it, opened it up, shut the lid. &#x201c;Ah! Anchovies. You know what Churchill said about anchovies: &#x2018;A delicacy favored by English lords and Italian whores.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>There was a short silence. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;d be going to New Mexico?&#x201d; Carson asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct. Your part of the country, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I grew up in the Bootheel. At a place called Cottonwood Tanks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I knew it had a picturesque name. You probably won&#x2019;t find Mount Dragon as harsh as some of our other people have. The isolation and the desert setting can make it a difficult place to work. But you might actually enjoy it. There are horse stables there. I suppose you must be a fairly good rider, having grown up on a ranch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know a bit about horses,&#x201d; Carson said. Scopes had sure as hell done his research.<br>&#x201c;Not that you&#x2019;ll have much time for riding, of course. They&#x2019;ll run you ragged, no point in saying otherwise. But you&#x2019;ll be well compensated for it. A year&#x2019;s salary for the six-month tour, plus a fifty&#x2019;thousand-dollar bonus upon successful completion. And, of course, you&#x2019;ll have my personal gratitude.&#x201d;<br>Carson struggled with what he was hearing. The bonus alone equaled his current salary.<br>&#x201c;You probably know my management methods are a little unorthodox,&#x201d; Scopes continued. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be straight with you, Guy. There&#x2019;s a downside to this. If you fail to complete your part of the project in the necessary time frame, you&#x2019;ll be ex-cessed.&#x201d; He grinned, displaying oversized front teeth. &#x201c;But I have every confidence in you. I wouldn&#x2019;t put you in this position if I didn&#x2019;t think you could do it.&#x201d;<br>Carson had to ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help wondering why you chose me out of such a vast pool of talent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Even that I can&#x2019;t tell you. When you get briefed at Mount Dragon, everything will become clear, I promise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When would I begin?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Today. The company needs this product, Guy, and there&#x2019;s simply no time left. You can be on our plane before lunch. I&#x2019;ll have someone take care of your apartment, car, all the annoying details. Do you have a girlfriend?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Carson.<br>&#x201c;That makes things easier.&#x201d; Scopes smoothed down his cowlick, without success.<br>&#x201c;What about my supervisor, Fred Peck? I was supposed to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time. Just grab your PowerBook and go. The driver will take you home to pack a few things and call whoever. I&#x2019;ll send what&#x2019;s-his-name&#x2014;Peck?&#x2014;a note explaining things.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Brent, I want you to know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Scopes held up a hand. &#x201c;Please. Expressions of gratitude make me uncomfortable. &#x2018;Hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one.&#x2019; Give my offer ten minutes&#x2019; serious thought, Guy, and don&#x2019;t go anywhere.&#x201d;<br>The screen winked out on Scopes opening the pizza box again.<br>As the lights came on, Carson&#x2019;s feeling of unreality was replaced by a surge of elation. He had no idea why Scopes had reached down among the five thousand GeneDyne Ph.D.s and picked him, busy with his repetitive titrations and quality-control checks. But for the moment he didn&#x2019;t care. He thought of Peck hearing thirdhand that Scopes had personally assigned him to Mount Dragon. He thought of the look on the fat face, the wattles quivering in consternation.<br>There was a low rumbling noise as the curtains drew back from the windows, exposing the dreary vista beyond, cloaked in curtains of rain. In the gray distance, Carson could make out the power lines and smokestacks and chemical effluvia that were central New Jersey. Somewhere farther west lay a desert, with eternal sky and distant blue mountains and the pungent smell of greasewood, where you could ride all day and night and never see another human being. Somewhere in that desert stood Mount Dragon, and within it, his own secret chance to do something important.<br>Ten minutes later, when the curtains closed and the video screen came once again to life, Carson had his answer ready.<br>Copyright � 1996 by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child</p><h2>The Braxtons of Miracle Springs</h2><p>Christopher and Corrie Braxton make their first little home in the bunkhouse connected to her father&#39;s barn, but danger from the past comes stalking Pa Hollister and threatens the happy family.

One of the most colorful characters from the wild and woolly days of Fort Worth&#x2019;s Hell&#x2019;s Half Acre, Courtright was at various times city marshal, deputy sheriff, deputy U.S. marshal, private detective, hired killer, and racketeer. Today, he is almost forgotten, either as a gunfighter or a lawman, except in Fort Worth.<br><br>Little is known about Courtright&#x2019;s early life, though he apparently served in the Union army during the Civil War. But when he arrived in the West, Courtright seemed to attract trouble. He was involved in a shootout during the 1886 railroad strikes and was accused of murder in New Mexico. Deputies were sent to Fort Worth to escort him to New Mexico to stand trial. His escape from them, complete with guns hidden under a restaurant table, is one of Fort Worth&#x2019;s most colorful stories. Finally, he was killed in a shootout that he apparently provoked with gambler and gunman Luke Short. To this day nobody is sure what provoked that feud, but Courtright was honored with the longest funeral procession Fort Worth had ever seen.<br><br>The myth of Courtright as legendary gunfighter was built in two previous biographies&#x2014;one by a novelist and the other by a Franciscan priest. After exhaustive research into contemporary newspapers and other accounts and close study of the previous two books, historian Robert K. DeArment deconstructs the myth of Longhair Jim and reconstructs the gunfighter as a real human being, complex, flawed, often courageous, usually both honorable and dishonorable.<br><br>This book is a must for all those interested in the legends of the West, its lawmen, and its outlaws.</p><p>Robert K. DeArment has made a lifelong study of the establishment of law on the American frontier and the gunfighters, outlaws, and lawmen who were part of that story. He is the author of numerous books and articles and a member of Western Writers of America, Inc., the Western Outlaw&#x2013;Lawman History Association, and the National Association for Outlaws and Lawman History. He has been honored for his writing by both WOLA and NOLA.</p><h2>Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 9)</h2><p><p>Sullivan Quinn didn't travel 3,000 miles from his native Ireland and his wolf pack just to chase rabidly after the most delectable quarry he's ever seen.

In the brilliant dual biography, the award-winning writer Roland Huntford re-examines every detail of the great race to the South Pole between Britain&#39;s Robert Scott and Norway&#39;s Roald Amundsen. Scott, who dies along with four of his men only eleven miles from his next cache of supplies, became Britain&#39;s beloved failure, while Amundsen, who not only beat Scott to the Pole but returned alive, was largely forgotten. This account of their race is a gripping, highly readable history that captures the driving ambitions of the era and the complex, often deeply flawed men who were charged with carrying them out. THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH is the first of Huntford&#39;s masterly trilogy of polar biographies. It is also the only work on the subject in the English language based on the original Norwegian sources, to which Huntford returned to revise and update this edition.</p><p>On December 14, 1911, the classical age of polar exploration ended when Norway's Roald Amundsen conquered the South Pole. His competitor for the prize, Britain's Robert Scott, arrived one month later--but died on the return with four of his men only 11 miles from their next cache of supplies. But it was Scott, ironically, who became the legend, Britain's heroic failure, "a monument to sheer ambition and bull-headed persistence. His achievement was to perpetuate the romantic myth of the explorer as martyr, and ... to glorify suffering and self-sacrifice as ends in themselves." The world promptly forgot about Amundsen.<p> Biographer Ronald Huntford's attempt to restore Amundsen to glory, first published in 1979 under the title <i>Scott and Amundsen</i>, has been thawed as part of the Modern Library Exploration series, captained by Jon Krakauer (of <i>Into Thin Air</i> fame). <i>The Last Place on Earth</i> is a complex and fascinating account of the race for this last great terrestrial goal, and it's pointedly geared toward demythologizing Scott. Though this was the age of the amateur explorer, Amundsen was a professional: he left little to chance, apprenticed with Eskimos, and obsessed over every detail. While Scott clung fast to the British rule of "No skis, no dogs," Amundsen understood that both were vital to survival, and they clearly won him the Pole. </p><p> Amundsen in Huntford's view is the "last great Viking" and Scott his bungling opposite: "stupid ... recklessly incompetent," and irresponsible in the extreme--failings that cost him and his teammates their lives. Yet for all of Scott's real or exaggerated faults, he understood far better than Amundsen the power of a well-crafted sentence. Scott's diaries were recovered and widely published, and if the world insisted on lionizing Scott, it was partly because he told a better story. Huntford's bias aside, it's clear that both Scott and Amundsen were valiant and deeply flawed. "Scott ... had set out to be an heroic example. Amundsen merely wanted to be first at the pole. Both had their prayers answered." <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>"A remarkably vivid picture of the agonies and feuds, as well as joys,<br>of polar exploration . . . a fascinating book."--The New York Times<br><br>"An extraordinarily rich reading experience."--Los Angeles Times<br><br>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the South Pole was the most coveted prize in the fiercely nationalistic modern age of exploration.

This collaboration first began when Katra helped Targ miraculously cure himself of metastatic cancer. Skeptics will probably find themselves impressed by the thoroughness of Targ's research as well as his highly plausible conclusions. For example, Targ reveals for the first time the startling results of declassified CIA experiments in psychic spying during the Cold War. Believers in spiritual healing will find support in Katra's impressive credentials and rich storytelling. The authors share a gift for engaging but spare prose, which makes for highly palatable reading, despite the density of ideas and information. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><h2>The Lost Sisterhood: A Novel</h2><p>From the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Juliet</i> comes a mesmerizing novel about a young scholar who risks her reputation&#x2014;and her life&#x2014;on a thrilling journey to prove that the legendary warrior women known as the Amazons actually existed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oxford lecturer Diana Morgan is an expert on Greek mythology. Her obsession with the Amazons started in childhood when her eccentric grandmother claimed to be one herself&#x2014;before vanishing without a trace. Diana&#x2019;s colleagues shake their heads at her Amazon fixation. But then a mysterious, well-financed foundation makes Diana an offer she cannot refuse.<br> &nbsp;<br> Traveling to North Africa, Diana teams up with Nick Barran, an enigmatic Middle Eastern guide, and begins deciphering an unusual inscription on the wall of a recently unearthed temple. There she discovers the name of the first Amazon queen, Myrina, who crossed the Mediterranean in a heroic attempt to liberate her kidnapped sisters from Greek pirates, only to become embroiled in the most famous conflict of the ancient world&#x2014;the Trojan War. Taking their cue from the inscription, Diana and Nick set out to find the fabled treasure that Myrina and her Amazon sisters salvaged from the embattled city of Troy so long ago. Diana doesn&#x2019;t know the nature of the treasure, but she does know that someone is shadowing her, and that Nick has a sinister agenda of his own. With danger lurking at every turn, and unsure of whom to trust, Diana finds herself on a daring and dangerous quest for truth that will forever change her world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sweeping from England to North Africa to Greece and the ruins of ancient Troy, and navigating between present and past, <i>The Lost Sisterhood</i> is a breathtaking, passionate adventure of two women on parallel journeys, separated by time, who must fight to keep the lives and legacy of the Amazons from being lost forever.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Lost Sisterhood</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Impossible to put down . . .

Stamping hooves, rushing chariots, rapacious males . . . thanks to Granny, I had it more or less cased by the age of ten.<br><br>Alas, the world turned out so very different from the noble battleground she had led me to expect. The stakes were puny, the people gray and gutless; my Amazon arts were futile here. And certainly nothing Granny taught me during our long afternoons of mint tea and imagined monsters could buoy me for the currents and crosswinds of academia.<br><br>On this particular October afternoon&#x2014;the day it all started&#x2014; I was knocked down by an unexpected gust of wrath halfway through a conference paper. Prompted by the almighty Professor Vandenbosch in the front row, the discussion leader sprang to her feet and drew a cowardly finger across her throat to let me know I had precisely zero minutes left to finish my lecture. According to my own wristwatch I was perfectly on time, but my academic future depended on the favor of these distinguished scholars.<br><br>&#x201c;To conclude&#x201d;&#x2014;I stole a glance at Professor Vandenbosch, who sat with his arms and legs crossed, peering at me with belligerent eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;it becomes clear that despite all the graphic descriptions of their mating habits, these Greek authors never saw the swashbuckling Amazons as anything more than fictitious, quasi-erotic playmates.&#x201d;<br><br>A rustle of enthusiasm went through the auditorium. Everyone had been sodden and rather glum coming in from the rainy quad earlier, but my lecture had clearly done its bit to warm up the room.<br><br>&#x201c;However&#x201d;&#x2014;I nodded at the discussion leader to assure her I was almost finished&#x2014;&#x201c;the knowledge that these bloodthirsty female warriors were pure fiction did not stop our writers from using them in cautionary tales about the dangers of unbridled female liberty. Why?&#x201d; I panned the audience, trying to count my allies. &#x201c;Why were Greek men compelled to keep their wives imprisoned in the home? We don&#x2019;t know. But surely this Amazon scaremongering would have served to justify their misogyny.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as the applause had waned, Professor Vandenbosch short-circuited the discussion leader by standing up and looking around sternly, mowing down the many eagerly raised hands with his gaze alone. Then he turned to me, a little smirk on his venerable face. &#x201c;Thank you, Dr. Morgan. I am gratified to discover that I am no longer the most antiquated scholar at Oxford. For your sake I hope the �academy will one day come to need feminism again; the rest of us, I am relieved to say, have long since moved along and buried the old battle-ax.&#x201d;<br><br>Although his charge was disguised as a joke, it was so outrageous that no one laughed. Even I, trapped behind the lectern, was too shocked to attempt a riposte. Most of the audience was on my side, I was sure of it&#x2014;and yet no one dared to stand up and defend me. The silence in the room was so complete you could hear the faint plunking of raindrops on the copper roof.<br><br>Ten mortifying minutes later I was able to flee the lecture hall at last and retreat into the wet October fog. Drawing my shawl more tightly around me, I tried to visualize the teapot awaiting me at home . . . but was still too furious.<br><br>Professor Vandenbosch had never liked me. According to a particularly malicious report, he had once entertained his peers with a fantasy in which I was stolen away from Oxford to star in a girl-power TV series. My own theory was that he was using me to ruffle his rival, my mentor Katherine Kent, thinking he could weaken her position by attacking her favorites.<br><br>Katherine, of course, had warned me against giving another lecture on the Amazons. &#x201c;If you continue down this path of inquiry,&#x201d; she had said, blunt as always, &#x201c;you will become academic roadkill.&#x201d;<br><br>I refused to believe her. One day the subject would catch, and Professor Vandenbosch would be helpless to smother the flames. If only I could find time to finish my book, or, best of all, get my hands on the Historia Amazonum. One more letter to Istanbul, handwritten this time, and maybe Grigor Reznik&#x2019;s magic cave would finally open. I owed it to Granny to try.<br><br>Scuttling down the soppy street, my shirt collar up against the elements, I was too preoccupied to notice someone following until a man caught up with me at the High Street crosswalk and took the liberty of holding his umbrella over me. He looked a sprightly sixty and was �certainly no academic; underneath his spotless trench coat I spied an �expensive suit, and I suspected his socks matched the tie.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Morgan,&#x201d; he began, his accent betraying South African origins. &#x201c;I enjoyed your talk. Do you have a moment?&#x201d; He nodded at the Grand Caf� across the street. &#x201c;Can I buy you a drink? You look as if you need one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very kind of you&#x201d;&#x2014;I checked my wristwatch&#x2014;&#x201c;but unfortunately, I am late for another appointment.&#x201d; And I really was. Since it was recruiting week at the university fencing club, I had promised to pop by after hours to help demonstrate the equipment. A convenient arrangement, as it turned out, since I was very much in the mood to lunge at a few imaginary foes.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh&#x2014;&#x201d; The man proceeded to follow me down the street, the tips of his umbrella stabbing at my hair. &#x201c;How about later? Are you free tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. There was something unsettling about the man&#x2019;s eyes; they were uncommonly intense and had a jaundiced tint to them, not unlike those of the owls perched on top of the bookcases in my father&#x2019;s study.<br><br>Instead of turning down the dark and mostly deserted Magpie Lane, I stopped at the corner with what I hoped was a friendly smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I didn&#x2019;t catch your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;John Ludwig.

I have an invitation for you.&#x201d; He looked at me with a squint of deliberation, as if to reassure himself of my worthiness. &#x201c;The foundation I work with has made a sensational discovery.&#x201d; He paused and frowned, clearly uncomfortable with the public setting. &#x201c;Are you sure I can&#x2019;t buy you a drink?&#x201d;<br><br>Despite my erstwhile apprehensions, I couldn&#x2019;t help a twitch of curiosity. &#x201c;Perhaps we could meet tomorrow?&#x201d; I offered. &#x201c;For a quick coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ludwig glanced at a few hunched passersby before leaning closer. &#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; he said, his voice dropping to an intimate whisper, &#x201c;you and I will be on our way to Amsterdam.&#x201d; Seeing the shock on my face, he had the nerve to smile. &#x201c;First class.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right!&#x201d; I ducked away from the umbrella and started down Magpie Lane. &#x201c;Good day, Mr. Ludwig&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; He trailed me down the alley, easily matching my pace on the uneven pavement. &#x201c;I am talking about a discovery that is going to rewrite history. It&#x2019;s a brand-new excavation, top secret, and guess what: We&#x2019;d like you to take a look at it.&#x201d;<br><br>My steps slowed. &#x201c;Why me? I&#x2019;m not an archaeologist. I&#x2019;m a philologist. As you are doubtlessly aware, philology is not about digging, but about reading and deciphering&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Precisely!&#x201d; Burrowing into the same pockets that had failed to produce his business card, Mr. Ludwig extracted a bent photograph. &#x201c;What we need is someone who can make sense of this.&#x201d;<br><br>Even in the murk of Magpie Lane I was able to see that the photograph showed an inscription on what appeared to be an ancient plaster wall. &#x201c;Where was this taken?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That I can&#x2019;t tell you. Not until you agree to come.&#x201d; Mr. Ludwig stepped closer, his voice low with secrecy. &#x201c;You see, we&#x2019;ve found proof that the Amazons really did exist.&#x201d;<br><br>I was so surprised I nearly started laughing. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ludwig snapped upright. &#x201c;Excuse me, but I am very serious.&#x201d; He opened his arms, umbrella and all, as if to demonstrate the enormity of the matter. &#x201c;This is your field. Your passion. Is it not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but&#x2014;&#x201d; I glanced at the photograph, not immune to its lure. Every six months or so, I would come across an article about an archaeologist who claimed to have found a genuine Amazon burial, or even the legendary city of women, Themiscyra. The articles were usually headlined new find proves amazons really did exist, and I always read through them eagerly, only to be disappointed. Yes, another weather-beaten diehard with a hooded parka had spent a lifetime combing the Black Sea region for women buried with weapons and horses. And, yes, occasionally he or she would find evidence of a prehistoric tribe that hadn&#x2019;t prevented females from riding and carrying weapons. To claim, however, that those women had lived in a manless Amazon society that occasionally clashed with the ancient Greeks in spectacular battles . . . well, that was a bit like finding a dinosaur skeleton and deducing that fire-breathing fairy-tale dragons had once been reality.<br><br>Mr. Ludwig looked at me with his owl eyes. &#x201c;Do you really want me to believe that after spending, what, nine years researching the Amazons there is not a tiny part of Diana Morgan that wants to prove they really lived?&#x201d; He nodded at the photograph he had given me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at a hitherto undeciphered Amazon alphabet, and get this: We are giving you the chance to be the first academic to take a stab at it. Plus, we&#x2019;re going to compensate you handsomely for your time. Five thousand dollars for one week&#x2019;s work&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a minute,&#x201d; I said, my teeth chattering with cold and the shock of it all. &#x201c;What makes you so certain this inscription has anything to do with the Amazons?&#x201d; I waved the photograph in front of him. &#x201c;You just told me it has not yet been deciphered&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; Mr. Ludwig pointed at my nose, almost touching it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s precisely the kind of smart thinking we&#x2019;re looking for. Here&#x2014;&#x201d; He reached into an inner pocket and handed me an envelope. &#x201c;This is your plane ticket. We leave from Gatwick tomorrow afternoon. I&#x2019;ll see you at the gate.&#x201d;<br><br>And that was it. Without even waiting for my reaction, Mr. Ludwig simply turned and walked away, disappearing into the flurry of High Street without looking back once.</p><h2>Hands-On Bible NLT</h2><p><b>2005 Gold Medallion Award winner!</b> <br><br>Jesus taught with hands-on lessons and illustrations.

It takes the form of the autobiography of Bernardo Soares, a Lisbon clerk.</p><p>Fernando Pessoa, one of the founders of modernism, was born in Lisbon in 1888. He grew up in Durban, South Africa, where his stepfather was Portuguese consul. He returned to Lisbon in 1905 and worked as a clerk in an import-export company until his death in 1935. Most of Pessoa&#39;s writing was not published during his lifetime: The Book of Disquiet first came out in Portugal in 1982. Since its first publication, it has been hailed as a classic.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Portugese</p><h2>The Existential Background of Human Dignity</h2><p>White dust jacket with black text</p><p></p><h2>Proleterka PB</h2><p><p>Compressed, delicate and brutally precise, Proleterka is a fierce coming-of-age story.</p> <p>A fifteen-year-old girl and her father, Johannes, take a cruise to Greece on the <i>Proleterka</i>. Jaeggy recounts the girl&#x2019;s youth in her distinctively strange, telescopic prose: the remarried mother, cold and unconcerned; the father who was allowed only rare visits with the child; the years spent stashed away with relatives or at boarding school. For the girl and her father, their time on the ship becomes their &#x2018;last and first chance to be together.&#x2019; On board, she becomes the object of the sailors&#x2019; affection, receiving a violent, carnal education. Mesmerised by the desire to be experienced, she crisply narrates her trysts as well as her near-total neglect of her father. <i>Proleterka</i> is a ferocious study of distance, diffidence and &#x2018;insomniac resentment&#x2019;.</p></p><p></p><h2>Another Homecoming</h2><p>In the wake of her husband&#39;s presumed death, a young war bride makes a desperate choice to give her baby a better life. However, her choice will have unforeseen ramifications for more lives than she ever expected. The baby girl, named Kyle by her adoptive parents, grows up with no knowledge of her humble beginnings. When a heartbreaking loss pits Kyle against her high society mother, secrets from Kyle&#39;s past come to light. Suddenly, she finds herself searching for the family she never knew and a faith she&#39;s only beginning to understand. With all that has come before, will Kyle ever be able to find home?</p><p>Janette Oke has more than thirty million copies of her books in print. She has also won both the Gold Medallion Award and the Christy Award for fiction. Janette and her husband, Edward, live in Alberta, Canada. Davis Bunn, the author of twenty bestsellers, has received numerous accolades, including three Christy Awards. He and his wife, Isabella, make their home near Oxford, England.Christian fiction powerhouses Oke and Bunn team up again (after Return to Harmony, Bethany, 1996) with a story of wartime romance and its tragic consequences. Martha and Harry Grimes were married for only nine weeks when he was sent overseas during World War II. When Harry is declared "missing and presumed dead," 18-year-old Martha panics at the thought of raising their expected child alone. When the baby girl is born, Martha gives it up for adoption. When Harry is found to be alive, though gravely wounded, it is too late for Martha to get their baby back. Returning home from war, Harry is bitter over his wounds and refuses to forgive Martha for her action. Though they have other children, the couple is never truly happy; their children grow up incomplete and eventually become Christians, which allows them to bring Harry and Martha back together. This is a truly unique and touching view of the effects of Christian belief on ordinary lives. It is beautifully written and should satisfy the authors' many fans.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Buddha (Penguin Lives)</h2><p>The author of The Battle for God and other works on religion focuses her attention on the Buddha, retracing his life from prince to savior of humankind.</p><p>Books on Buddhism may overflow the shelves, but the life story of the Buddha himself has remained obscure despite over 2,500 years of influence on millions of people around the world. In an attempt to rectify this, and to make the Buddha and Buddhism accessible to Westerners, the beloved scholar and author of such sweeping religious studies as <i>A History of God</i> has written a readable, sophisticated, and somewhat unconventional biography of one of the most influential people of all time. Buddha himself fought against the cult of personality, and the Buddhist scriptures were faithful, giving few details of his life and personality. Karen Armstrong mines these early scriptures, as well as later biographies, then fleshes the story out with an explanation of the cultural landscape of the 6th century B.C., creating a deft blend of biography, history, philosophy, and mythology.<p> At the age of 29, Siddhartha Gautama walked away from the insulated pleasure palace that had been his home and joined a growing force of wandering monks searching for spiritual enlightenment during an age of upheaval. Armstrong traces Gautama's journey through yoga and asceticism and grounds it in the varied religious teachings of the time. In many parts of the world during this so-called axial age, new religions were developing as a response to growing urbanization and market forces. Yet each shared a common impulse--they placed faith increasingly on the individual who was to seek inner depth rather than magical control. Taoism and Confucianism, Hinduism, monotheism in the Middle East and Iran, and Greek rationalism were all emerging as Gautama made his determined way towards enlightenment under the boddhi tree and during the next 45 years that he spent teaching along the banks of the Ganges. Armstrong, in her intelligent and clarifying style, is quick to point out the Buddha's relevance to our own time of transition, struggle, and spiritual void in both his approach--which was based on skepticism and empiricism--and his teachings. </p><p> Despite the lack of typical historical documentation, Armstrong has written a rich and revealing description of both a unique time in history and an unusual man. <i>Buddha</i> is a terrific primer for those interested in the origins and fundamentals of Buddhism. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Karen Armstrong's books include <i>The Battle for God</i>, <i>A History of God: The 4000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam</i>; <i>Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths</i>; and <i>In the Beginning: A New Interpretation of Genesis</i>.

How this curious creature and others as humble (and as fast-breeding) have helped unlock the mystery of inheritance is the unlikely story Jim Endersby tells in this book. </p><p> Biology today promises everything from better foods or cures for common diseases to the alarming prospect of redesigning life itself. Looking at the organisms that have made all this possible gives us a new way of understanding how we got here--and perhaps of thinking about where we're going. Instead of a history of which great scientists had which great ideas, this story of passionflowers and hawkweeds, of zebra fish and viruses, offers a bird's (or rodent's) eye view of the work that makes science possible. </p><p> Mixing the celebrities of genetics, like the fruit fly, with forgotten players such as the evening primrose, the book follows the unfolding history of biological inheritance from Aristotle's search for the "universal, absolute truth of fishiness" to the apparently absurd speculations of eighteenth-century natural philosophers to the spectacular findings of our day--which may prove to be the absurdities of tomorrow. </p><p> The result is a quirky, enlightening, and thoroughly engaging perspective on the history of heredity and genetics, tracing the slow, uncertain path--complete with entertaining diversions and dead ends--that led us from the ancient world's understanding of inheritance to modern genetics. </p></p><p>Dr. Jim Endersby is a lecturer in the History Department at the University of Sussex. He was most recently an affiliated lecturer in the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University.<i>A Guinea Pig's History of Biology</i> is a fascinatingly different take on the history of evolution, showing how science developed as a complex and fruitful interaction between individuals and the scientific world. As entertaining as it is enlightening. <br> --Judith Flanders, author of <i>Consuming Passions: Leisure and Pleasure in Victorian Britain</i><br><br>In this astute, charming and witty book, Jim Endersby follows the careers of passionflowers and fruit flies, mice and fish and helps overthrow a host of myths that have beset the history of biology. He brings uncommon enthusiasm and infectious passion to his accounts of gardeners and travellers, farmers and priests. He shares his joy at gazing through microscopes at zebrafish, offers indispensable information about the roots of genetic modification and vivisection and concludes with a superbly judged exploration of the significance of campaigns around biotechnology and eugenics. This book will become a vital resource for anyone who cares about where our biological knowledge came from and why it matters so much to our future. <br> --Simon Schaffer, Professor of History of Science, University of Cambridge<br><br>Try to skim this book and you'll find yourself drawn into reading every word. Eye-opening and entertaining, this is cutting-edge history of science that everyone should read. Discover why Charles Darwin puzzled over passion flowers, and how the most unlikely of experimental organisms--from guinea pigs to an unprepossessing cress plant--contributed to what are now hailed as landmark discoveries, as well as leading to a lot of dead ends. Throughout his gripping narrative, Jim Endersby shows how today's right answer is almost always tomorrow's wrong one. <br> --Gail Vines (<i>New Scientist</i> 2007-05-12)<br><br>The conceit of this engaging book is to tell how biologists have come to understand heredity from the point of view of some of the plants and animals that have been its central subjects. From observations made in the stable and greenhouse--of Arabian mares and passionflowers--Endersby traces the development of a model organism's approach to biology in the modern laboratory, culminating in chapters on Zebrafish and Arabidopsis. More truly a history of genetics than a history of biology, the book is illuminating and entertaining throughout. <br> --Angela Creager, Princeton University<br><br>Jim Endersby's book is packed with strange lore about the creatures that live in laboratories, but it is no mere miscellany. He has hit upon the bright idea of telling the story of reproduction, inheritance and evolution--and how we learnt about them, by focusing on the handful of creatures that have provided most of our knowledge: the fruitfly, the zebrafish, the bacteriophage, Darwin's passion flowers, maize, the evening primrose, the cress plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> and a few others. Oh, and not forgetting <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Endersby's technique is a wonderfully roundabout way of telling some of the great stories of modern biology.<br> --Peter Forbes (<i>Daily Mail</i> 2007-05-18)<br><br>Over the past two decades, dozens of popular books discussing the Darwinian perspective on the history of biology have appeared, many of them derivative and stale. Some of us are feeling rather Darwinned out. But Jim Endersby has come up with a fresh and rewarding approach. He illuminates the story of our understanding of life since 1800 (when the word biology was coined) by focusing on 12 organisms that have been most useful to natural scientists in illuminating one of life's central mysteries, inheritance. The result is a hefty, easily readable account of the remarkable progress biologists have made over the past two centuries to enrich our understanding of life...Much of the charm of Endersby's account derives from his meandering style and his eye for the telling incident...Endersby's account of how zebra fish became one of nature's most revealing organisms is a gem of popular science writing, both an entertainment and an education. It demonstrates that a talented historian can illuminate science that has come to appear jaded after too many retellings by authors with a meagre grasp of their subject's past.<br> --Graham Farmelo (<i>Sunday Telegraph</i> 2007-05-20)<br><br>By telling the laboratory life-stories of <i>Passiflora</i>, <i>Oenothera</i>, <i>Drosophila</i>, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Danio</i>, as well as the trusty <i>Cavia porcellus</i> and one or two others, the historian Jim Endersby reveals how humans have unravelled the mysteries of evolution, genetics and development to such an extent that we can now, up to a point, engineer life itself...Endersby introduces us to many more names, less famous but each a crucial contributor to modern biology. Through their stories he explodes the persistent myth that science is a series of eureka moments by heroic individuals, instead revealing a complex reality of social interaction and interdependence...An account that draws much of its fascination from unexpected connections. With an enviable lightness of touch, Endersby weaves his scientific threads into a much broader tapestry of cultural history...Accessible and engaging.<br> --Georgina Ferry (<i>The Guardian</i> 2007-06-02)<br><br>Endersby has written a brilliant popular history of modern biology. Having mastered a vast scholarly literature, he expertly sets the science in its cultural context, explains difficult scientific concepts clearly, and offers a wise and entertaining account of some of the most important lines of research in the study of heredity, variation, and evolution over two centuries. <br> --Sharon E. Kingsland, author of <i>Modelling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology</i><br><br>A highly entertaining and original book. Science is a collaborative process and by looking at the roles played by unwilling collaborators, from guinea pigs to zebrafish, Endersby provides a new perspective on the history of genetics.<br> --Nick Rennison (<i>Sunday Times</i> 2007-06-10)<br><br>Endersby, a young historian of science, has had the neat idea of telling the stories of the creatures which became the emblems of the modern lab. It offers an unusual viewpoint on the path from natural history, which grew from observing living things in the wild, to the biological laboratory...Endersby's engaging book covers a good range of the most important lab beasts, and chooses its stories well. It is an absorbing tale of the way our understanding of genetics has depended on a crucial set of involuntary collaborators, the unsung heroes of the laboratory.<br> --Jon Turney (<i>The Independent</i> 2007-06-29)</p><h2>The Neon Rain</h2><p>Dave Robicheaux, a New Orleans detective, discovers that someone wants him dead and becomes involved with drug dealers, Mafia chieftains, an ex-general with shady dealings in Central America, and a beautiful woman</p><p><b>James Lee Burke,</b> a rare winner of two Edgar Awards, is the author of twenty-one novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Sunset Limited, Cimarron Rose, Cadillac Jukebox, Burning Angel, Dixie City Jam, Purple Cane Road, Bitterroot,</i> and <i>Jolie Blon's Bounce.</i> He lives with his wife in Missoula, Montana, and New Iberia, Louisiana.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> The evening sky was streaked with purple, the color of torn plums, and a light rain had started to fall when I came to the end of the blacktop road that cut through twenty miles of thick, almost impenetrable scrub oak and pine and stopped at the front gate of Angola penitentiary. The anti-capital-punishment crowd -- priests, nuns in lay clothes, kids from LSU with burning candles cupped in their hands -- were praying outside the fence. But another group was there too -- a strange combination of frat boys and rednecks -- drinking beer from Styrofoam coolers filled with cracked ice; they were singing "Glow, Little Glow Worm," and holding signs that read THIS BUD IS FOR YOU, MASSINA AND JOHNNY, START YOUR OWN SIZZLER FRANCHISE TODAY. </p><p> "I'm Lieutenant Dave Robicheaux, New Orleans police department," I said to one of the guards on the gate. I opened my badge for him. </p><p> "Oh yeah, Lieutenant. I got your name on my clipboard. I'll ride with you up to the Block," he said, and got in my car. His khaki sleeves were rolled over his sunburned arms, and he had the flat green eyes and heavy facial bones of north Louisiana hill people. He smelled faintly of dried sweat, Red Man, and talcum powder. "I don't know which bunch bothers me worse. Those religious people act like we're frying somebody for a traffic citation, and those boys with the signs must not be getting much pussy over at the university. You staying for the whole thing?" </p><p> "Nope." </p><p> "Did you nail this guy or something?" </p><p> "He was just a low-level button man I used to run in once in a while. I never got him on anything. In fact, I think he screwed up more jobs than he pulled off. Maybe he got into the mob through Affirmative Action." </p><p> The guard didn't laugh. He looked out the window at the huge, flat expanse of the prison farm, his eyes narrowing whenever we passed a trusty convict walking along the dirt road. The main living area of the prison, a series of two-story, maximum-security dormitories contained within a wire fence and connected by breezeways and exercise yards and collectively called the Block, was as brilliantly lit as cobalt in the rain, and in the distance I could see the surgically perfect fields of sugar cane and sweet potatoes, the crumbling ruins of the nineteenth-century camps silhouetted against the sun's red afterglow, the willows bent in the breeze along the Mississippi levee, under which many a murdered convict lay buried. </p><p> "They still keep the chair in the Red Hat House?" I said. </p><p> "You got it. That's where they knock the fire out their ass. You know how the place come by that name?" </p><p> "Yes," I said, but he wasn't listening. </p><p> "Back before they started putting the mean ones in lockdown in the Block, they worked them down by the river and made them wear striped jumpers and these red-painted straw hats. Then at night they stripped them down, body-searched them, then run them into the Red Hat House and threw their clothes in after them. There wasn't no screens on the windows, and them mosquitoes would make a Christian out of a man when a baseball bat couldn't." </p><p> I parked the car and we entered the Block, passed through the first lockdown area, where both the snitches and the dangerous ones stayed, walked down the long, brilliantly lit breezeway between the recreation yards into the next dormitory, passed through another set of hydraulic locks and a dead space where two hacks sat at a table playing cards and where a sign overhead read no guns beyond this point, into the rec and dining halls where the black trustees were running electric waxers on the gleaming floors, and finally walked up the spiral iron steps to a small maximum-security corner where Johnny Massina was spending the last three hours of his life. </p><p> The guard from the gate left me, and another one pulled the single lever that slid back the cell door. Johnny wore a white shirt, a pair of black slacks, and black Air Force shoes with white socks. His wiry gray and black hair was dripping with sweat, and his face was the color and texture of old paper. He looked up at me from where he was seated on his bunk, and his eyes were hot and bright and moisture was beaded across his upper lip. He held a Camel cigarette between his yellowed fingers, and the floor around his feet was covered with cigarette butts. </p><p> "Streak, I'm glad you come. I didn't know if you were going to make it," he said. </p><p> "How you doing, Johnny?" </p><p> His hands clutched his thighs and he looked at the floor, then back at me. I saw him swallow. </p><p> "How scared you ever been?" he said. </p><p> "In Vietnam I had some moments." </p><p> "That's right. You were over there, weren't you?" </p><p> "Way back in '64, before it got real hot." </p><p> "I bet you were a good soldier." </p><p> "I was just a live one, that's all." </p><p> I felt instantly stupid at my remark. He saw the regret in my face. </p><p> "Don't worry about it," he said. "I got a whole bunch of shit to tell you. Look, you remember when you took me to a couple of those AA meets, that step you guys take when you want to confess something, what'd you call it?" </p><p> "Step Five, admitting to yourself, God, and somebody else the exact nature of your faults." </p><p> "That's it. Well, I done it. To a colored preacher, yesterday morning. I told him every bad thing I ever done." </p><p> "That's good, Johnny." </p><p> "No, you listen. I told him the truth and I come clean with some really heavy shit, sexual things I always been ashamed of and I never understood. You know what I mean? I didn't keep nothing back. I also told him about the two guys I whacked in my life. I dumped one guy over the rail of a passenger liner on the way to Havana, and in 1958 I took out Bugsy Siegel's cousin with a shotgun. You know what it means to ice a relative of Bugsy Siegel? After I confessed it to the preacher, I told the guard and the assistant warden about it. You know these dumb cocksuckers couldn't care less? </p><p> "Wait a minute, let me finish. I told all this stuff because somebody's got to believe I didn't snuff that broad. I wouldn't throw no young girl out a hotel window, Streak. I got no kick coming about being fried. I figure it all comes out even in the end, but I want these bastards to know I only pushed the button on guys that played by the same rules I did. Can you relate to that?" </p><p> "I think so. I'm glad you did a fifth step, too, Johnny." </p><p> He smiled for the first time. His face glistened in the light. "Hey, tell me something. Is it true Jimmie the Gent is your brother?" </p><p> "You hear a lot of bullshit in the street." </p><p> "You both got that black Cajun hair with a white patch in it, like you got skunk blood in you." He laughed. His mind was now moving away from the ride he would take in three hours, manacled in a waist chain, to the Red Hat House. "Once he contracted us for some poker machines for his places. After we put them in we told him he gets all his machines from us -- cigarettes, Pac-Man, and rubbers. So he says no rubbers, he's got class clubs and he don't put rubber machines in them. So we tell him he don't have a choice, he either buys the whole line or he don't get linen service, the Teamsters put a picket up on his sidewalk, and the parish health office finds out his dishwashers got leprosy. So what's he do? He invites Didoni Giacano -- Didi Gee himself -- and his whole family for lasagna at his restaurant, and they arrive on Sunday afternoon like a bunch of <i>cafoni</i> that just got off the boat from Palermo, because Didi thinks Jimmie has got respectable connections and is going to get him into the Knights of Columbus or something. Didi Gee probably weighs three hundred pounds and he's covered with hair like an animal and he scares the crap out of everybody in downtown New Orleans, but his mama is this little dried-up Sicilian lady that looks like a mummy wrapped in black rags and she still hits Didi on the hands with a spoon when he reaches across the table and don't ask. </p><p> "So in the middle of dinner Jimmie starts telling Mama Giacano what a great guy Didi Gee is, how everybody down at the Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau think he's a big plus for the city, and how Didi don't let anybody push his friends around. For example, he says, some scumbags tried to put some machines in Jimmie's restaurants that Jimmie, a Catholic man, don't want. Mama Giacano might look like she's made out of dried-up pasta, but her hot little black eyes tell everybody she knows what he's talking about. Then Jimmie says Didi tore them machines out, smashed them up with hammers, and run a truck up and down on them behind the restaurant. </p><p> "Didi Gee's got a mouthful of beer and raw oysters and almost chokes to death. He's spitting glop all over his plate, his kids are beating him on the back, and he coughs up an oyster that could plug a sewer main. Mama Giacano waits till his face ain't purple anymore, then tells him she didn't raise her son to eat like a herd of pigs and says he should go wash </p><p> out his mouth in the bathroom because everybody else at the table is getting sick looking at him, and when he don't get up right away she busts him across the knuckles with her spoon. Then Jimmie says he wants to take the whole family out on his sailboat and maybe Didi Gee ought to join the Yacht Club, too, because all these millionaires think he's a swell guy, and besides, Mama Giacano would really love the Italian-American celebrations they have on the Fourth of July and Columbus Day. And even if Didi don't join, which everybody knows he won't because he hates water and pukes his guts out just crossing the Mississippi ferry, Jimmie is going to drive out and get Mama Giacano whenever she wants and sail her all around Lake Pontchartrain." </p><p> He laughed again and ran his hand through his wet hair. He licked his lips and shook his head, and I saw the fear come back into his eyes. </p><p> "I bet he already told you that story, didn't he?" he said. </p><p> "They didn't give me too long, Johnny. Is there something else you wanted to tell me?" </p><p> "Yeah, there is. You always treated me decent and I thought maybe I could repay you a little bit." He wiped the sweat out of his eyes with the flat of his fingers. "I think maybe I got some heavy dues to pay on the other side, too. It don't hurt to try to square what you can now, does it?" </p><p> "You don't owe me." </p><p> "A guy with my track record owes the whole fucking earth. Anyway, here's the deal. Yesterday this punk by the name of L. J. Potts from Magazine Street is pushing a broom out in the corridor, clacking it against my bars and making all kinds of noise so I can't sleep. So I say I ain't working on the Good Housekeeping Award and would this punk take his broom somewhere else before I get my hands on it and shove it up his hole. So the punk, who's got a brother named Wesley Potts, tries to impress me. He asks if I know a New Orleans homicide roach named Robicheaux, and he's smirking, see, because he thinks you're one of the cops that nailed me. I tell him maybe, and he keeps smirking and says, well, here's some good news because his brother Wesley has it that this particular homicide roach has stuck his nose in the wrong place and if he don't stop it he's going to get whacked." </p><p> "He sounds like a gasbag, Johnny." </p><p> "Yeah, he probably is, except the difference with him and his brother is I think they're connected up with the greasers." </p><p> "The Colombians?" </p><p> "Fucking A. They're spreading around the country faster than AIDS. They'll take out anybody, too -- whole families, the children, the old people, it don't matter to them. You remember that bar on Basin that got torched? The greaser that did it stood in the doorway in broad daylight with a fucking flamethrower on his back and because he was in a good mood he gave everybody one minute to get out of the place before he melted it into a big pile of bubbling plastic. You watch out for those cocksuckers, Streak." </p><p> He lit a fresh Camel from the butt in his hand. He was sweating heavily now, and he wiped his face on his sleeve and smelled himself simultaneously. Then his face got gray and still and he stared straight ahead with his palms gripped on his thighs. </p><p> "You better leave now. I think I'm going to get sick again," he said. </p><p> "I think you're a stand-up guy, Johnny." </p><p> "Not on this one." </p><p> We shook hands. His hand was slick and light in mine.<br> </p><p> They electrocuted Johnny Massina at midnight. Back in my houseboat on Lake Pontchartrain, with the rain beating on the roof and dancing on the water outside, I remembered the lines I had heard sung once by a black inmate in Angola:<br> </p><p> <i>I ax my bossman, Bossman, tell me what's right.<br> He whupped my left, said, Boy, now you know what's right.<br> I wonder why they burn a man twelve o'clock hour at night.<br> The current much stronger; the peoples turn out all the light.</i><br> </p><p> My partner was Cletus Purcel. Our desks faced each other in a small room in the old converted fire station on Basin Street. Before the building was a fire station it had been a cotton warehouse, and before the Civil War slaves had been kept in the basement and led up the stairs into a dirt ring that served both as an auction arena and a cockfighting pit. </p><p> Cletus's face looked like it was made from boiled pigskin, except there were stitch scars across the bridge of his nose and through one eyebrow, where he'd been bashed by a pipe when he was a kid in the Irish Channel. He was a big man, with sandy hair and intelligent green eyes, and he fought to keep his weight down, unsuccessfully, by pumping iron four nights a week in his garage. </p><p> "Do you know a character named Wesley Potts?" I asked. </p><p> "Christ, yes. I went to school with him and his brothers. What a family. It was like having bread mold as your next-door neighbor." </p><p> "Johnny Massina said this guy's talking about pulling my plug." </p><p> "Sounds like bullshit to me. Potts is a gutless lowlife. He runs a dirty movie house on Bourbon. I'll introduce you to him this afternoon. You'll really enjoy this guy." </p><p> "I've got his file right here. Two narcotics, six obscenity busts, no convictions. Evidently one serious beef with the IRS." </p><p> "He fronts points for the greasers." </p><p> "That's what Massina said." </p><p> "All right, we'll go talk to him after lunch. You notice I say 'after lunch,' because this guy is your real genuine bucket of shit. By the way, the parish coroner in Cataouatche returned your call and said they didn't do an autopsy on that colored girl." </p><p> "What do you mean, they didn't do one?" I said. </p><p> "He said they didn't do one because the sheriff's office didn't request it. It went down as a drowning. What's all this about, anyway, Dave? Don't you have enough open cases without finding work down in Cataouatche Parish? Those people down there don't follow the same rules we do, anyway. You know that." </p><p> Two weeks before, I had been fishing in a pirogue on Bayou Lafourche, flycasting popping-bugs along the edge of the lily pads that grew out from the banks. The shore was thickly lined with cypress trees, and it was cool and quiet in the green-gold morning light that fell through the c...</p></p><h2>Respectable Sins: Confronting the Sins We Tolerate</h2><p>Have Christians become so preoccupied with &#x201c;major&#x201d; sins that we have lost sight of our need to deal with more subtle sins?

Still a commissioned vessel, she lies today at Portsmouth, England, where thousands visit her each year. Many marvel at her beauty and wonderful state of preservation, the result of the extraordinary work lavished on her over the past two hundred years. A must for Nelson enthusiasts, historians, and preservationists, this book tells the story of the painstaking historical research and fine craftsmanship that restored the ship to its age-of-sail glory. The narrative of the restoration is accompanied by two hundred recently commissioned drawings that show the ship as it was in 1805 and a hundred paintings and photographs. In addition to the technical details of construction and fittings, the book describes the <i>Victory</i>'s fabled career and what life on board was like for the officers and crew.</p><p></p><h2>Karma &amp; Karma Yoga</h2><p>&#34;Karma is manifestation of human nature.It is something which is expressed spontaneously,naturally and unconditionally,because this entire creation is nothing but manifestation of karma.The entire creation,the entire universe,the entire life is a manifeatation of karma,and the seed of karma in creation was placed by the cosmic will&#34; The Yogadrishti (Yogavision) series of satsangs consists of discourses given by Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati in Munger as part of the new phase of sannyasa life that he has embarked upon since 2009. karma and Karmayoga was the theme of the satsangs given in february 2010.The illuminating and in-depth discourses provide a fresh perspective on this timeless subject and also a clear map for the course of our life.The satsangs are one of the finest examples of Swami Niranjanananda&#39;s inimitable style:light yet deep,refreshing yet classical,profound yet practical.</p><p></p><h2>Philosophy: A Discovery in Comics</h2><p><p>This illustrated primer on philosophy is a great way to be introduced to a complex topic. In her easily accessible style, Margreet de Heer visualizes the history of Western philosophy and makes it approachable for those with little knowledge of the subject. The book explains the thoughts of philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Nietzsche, and ponders questions such as <i>What is thinking? What is reality? Is there free will?</i> and <i>Why are these ideas still important?</i> A perfect introduction to exploring philosophical concepts, this humorous yet substantive graphic account strips the subject of unnecessary complexity.</p></p><p>&#34;I believe in a PERSONAL approach, and this book is certainly proof of that. It has always bothered me that books about philosophy usually are written in a language that&#39;s hard to understand, and give the impression that the subjects they deal with, such as Reality, Infinity or Predestination, hardly have anything to do with day-to-day life. In this book I not only draw myself, but also my husband Yiri and our two cats to illuminate some philosophical concepts by showing how they come up in our own lives. Rather than give an exhaustive overview of philosophers since the dawn of time, I want to connect with the reader and show that everyone has his or her own philosophy about life. All you need to do is think.&#34;<b>Margreet de Heer</b> is a comic artist who collaborated on the online "Comiclopedia" on lambiek.net.

After school in England he went to work for Shell in Africa. He began to write after &#34;a monumental bash on the head&#34;, sustained as an RAF pilot in World War II. Roald Dahl died in 1990.Richard E. Grant uses a full range of tones and tempos to create distinct voices for all the characters in this story of Billy's encounter with the Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company. Grant's Pelly speaks with a speech impediment and a singsong rhythm; his monkey is slightly breathless, but, sadly, his giraffe does not sound female as the text clearly indicates. Grant shines when various characters sing; his portrayal of the opera star turned duchess singing about her stolen diamonds is a particular delight. Grant's straightforward narration lets Dahl's droll language and dialogue take center stage. This winning production will make the whole family smile.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."PreSchool-Grade 1 ``A muster of peacocks,'' ``a kindle of kittens,'' and other familiar and unusual collective nouns form the text of Heller's book. Bright, richly-colored oil pencil and line drawings enliven each set of objects, and some are exceptionally life-likeone can practically hear the crunch of the crusty loaves of bread and smell the bananas. Each group of items is presented in rhyme, which is remarkably smooth and unforced until the last page, when an explanation of the concept of col lective nouns, more suited to simple prose, intrudes. While ``. . .Jewels'' can be used to help children learn about parts of speech, its principal charm lies in the illustrations and the vocabulary itself, which will delight small eyes and ears.

People taking beta-blockers should therefore avoid taking potassium supplements, or eating large quantities of fruit (e.g., bananas), unless directed to do so by their doctor.<br><br> Interactions with Herbs<br><br> Pleurisy root<br><br> As pleurisy root and other plants in the Aesclepius genus contain cardiac glycosides, it is best to avoid use of pleurisy root with heart medications such as beta-blockers.<br><br> Interaction with Foods and Other Compounds<br><br> Taking acebutolol with food slows the rate of absorption and reduces the maximum blood levels of the drug, though overall absorption is not affected. However, the blood level of an active breakdown product of acebutolol is reduced. Though the activity of acebutolol is affected by food, people taking the drug on a daily basis are not likely to experience a reduction in the effectiveness of the drug if it is taken with a meal.<br><br> Acetaminophen<br><br> Common names: 222 AF, Abenol, Acetab, Acet, Alisphene Forte, Alvedon, Anadin Paracetamol, APAP, Apo-Acetaminophen, Artritol, Atasol, Boots Children&#x2019;s Pain Relief Syrup, Boots Cold Relief Hot Blackcurrant, Boots Cold Relief Hot Lemon, Boots Infant Pain Relief, Calpol 6 Plus, Calpol Infant, Calpol Pediatric, Calpol, Cephanol, Children&#x2019;s Acetaminophen, Children&#x2019;s Feverhalt, Cupanol Over 6, Cupanol Under 6, Disprol, Dom-Acetaminophen, Fanalgic, Fennings Children&#x2019;s Cooling Powders, Hill&#x2019;s Balsam Flu Strength Hot Lemon Powders, Infadrops, Lem-Plus Powders, Medinol, Novogesic, Pain Aid Free, Paldesic, Panaleve 6+, Panaleve Junior, Pandol, Panodol Baby and Infant, Paracetamol, Paracets, Paraclear, Paramin, Pediatrix, PMS Acetaminophen, Resolve, Robigesic Elixir, Rounox, Salzone, Tantaphen, Tempra, Tixymol, Tramil 500, Trianon, Tylenol, WestCan Extra Strength Acetaminophen, WestCan Regular Strength Acetaminophen<br><br> Combination drugs: Alka-Seltzer Plus, Co-Proxamol, Coalgesic, Darvocet N, Distalgesic, Endocet, Excedrin PM, Fioricet, Lortab, Midrin, Nyquil, Nyquil Hot Therapy Powder, Percocet, Phrenilin, Propacet 100, Roxicet, Theraflu, Tylenol Allergy Sinus, Tylenol Cold, Tylenol Flu NightTime Maximum Strength Powder, Tylenol Multi-Symptom Hot Medication, Tylenol PM, Tylenol Sinus, Tylenol with Codeine, Vicodin, Wygesic<br><br> Acetaminophen is used to reduce pain and fever.<br><br> Unlike NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) (page 000), it lacks anti-inflammatory activity.

NAC is often administered intravenously by emergency room doctors. Oral NAC appears to be effective for acetaminophen toxicity.<br><br> An uncontrolled trial compared intravenous NAC with oral NAC in children with acetaminophen poisoning and found that both methods were equally effective in reversing acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity. However, acetaminophen toxicity is a potential medical emergency, and should only be managed by qualified healthcare professionals.<br><br> Vitamin C<br><br> Taking 3 grams vitamin C with acetaminophen has been shown to prolong the amount of time acetaminophen stays in the body. This theoretically might allow people to use less acetaminophen, thereby reducing the risk of side effects. Consult with a doctor about this potential before reducing the amount of acetaminophen.<br><br> Interactions with Herbs<br><br> Hibiscus<br><br> One small study found that hibiscus could decrease levels of acetaminophen if the drug was taken after the tea was consumed though it was not entirely clear if the decreases were clinically significant.<br><br> Milk thistle (Silybum marianum)<br><br> Silymarin is a collection of complex flavonoids found in milk thistle that has been shown to elevate liver glutathione levels in rats. Acetaminophen can cause liver damage, which is believed to involve glutathione depletion. In one study involving rats, silymarin protected against acetaminophen-induced glutathione depletion. While studies to confirm this action in humans have not been conducted, some doctors recommend silymarin supplementation with 200 mg milk thistle extract, containing 70&#x2013;80% silymarin, three times per day for people taking acetaminophen in large amounts for more than one year and/or with other risk factors for liver problems.<br><br> Schisandra (Schisandra chinensis)<br><br> Gomisin A is a constituent found in the Chinese herb schisandra. In a study of rats given liver-damaging amounts of acetaminophen, gomisin A appeared to protect against some liver damage but did not prevent glutathione depletion (unlike milk thistle, as reported above).

Mild shelf wear from normal handling. Published in U:K. Satisfaction guaranteed!</p><p>You have never read a novel like this one. Winner of the 1991 Booker Prize for fiction, <i>The Famished Road</i> tells the story of Azaro, a spirit-child. Though spirit-children rarely stay long in the painful world of the living, when Azaro is born he chooses to fight death: "I wanted," he says, "to make happy the bruised face of the woman who would become my mother." Survival in his chaotic African village is a struggle, though. Azaro and his family must contend with hunger, disease, and violence, as well as the boy's spirit-companions, who are constantly trying to trick him back into their world. Okri fills his tale with unforgettable images and characters: the bereaved policeman and his wife, who try to adopt Azaro and dress him in their dead son's clothes; the photographer who documents life in the village and displays his pictures in a cabinet by the roadside; Madame Koto, "plump as a mighty fruit," who runs the local bar; the King of the Road, who gets hungrier the more he eats.<p> At the heart of this hypnotic novel are the mysteries of love and human survival. "It is more difficult to love than to die," says Azaro's father, and indeed, it is love that brings real sharpness to suffering here. As the story moves toward its climax, Azaro must face the consequences of choosing to live, of choosing to walk the road of hunger rather than return to the benign land of spirits. <i>The Famished Road</i> is worth reading for its last line alone, which must be one of the most devastating endings in contemporary literature (but don't skip ahead). <i>--R.

His books have received many awards, including the John Burroughs Young Reader Award, NCTE Notable Trade Books in the Language Arts, NSTA-CBS Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children, the Christopher Award, and others. He makes his home in a small village at the edge of the Hudson River.In a series of richly painted landscapes, Thomas Locker brings the world and words of John Muir to readers of all ages. Equally at home in the wilderness of California and Alaska, Muir was a fervid naturalist who wrote inspiring lyrical descriptions of nature for the benefit of future generations. He also founded the Sierra Club to encourage citizens to protect what he considered our greatest treasure: the natural world. With text and illustrations accompanied by excerpts from Muir&#39;s writings, John Muir allows readers to experience Muir&#39;s adventures in nature and his contagious passion for wild lands. He recognized that wilderness should not only be appreciated but should be fought for, and his life and work eventually sparked the preservationist movement in the United States and throughout the world. Includes a timeline of major events in Muir&#39;s life.</p><h2>Shame</h2><p>&#34;My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the early afternoon,&#34; begins Shame, the probing story of the twelve-year-old girl who will become the author herself, and the single traumatic memory that will echo and resonate throughout her life. With the emotionally rich voice of great fiction and the diamond-sharp analytical eye of a scientist, Annie Ernaux provides a powerful reflection on experience and the power of violent memory to endure through time, to determine the course of a life.</p><p>"My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the early afternoon." You'd expect a book that begins with these words to be a raw, anguished account of childhood trauma, but prize-winning French author Ernaux disdains such American-style obviousness. In order to explain why "that Sunday was like a veil that came between me and everything I did," Ernaux focuses not on individual psychology, but on "the codes and conventions of the circles in which I lived, [which determined] the vision I had of myself and the outside world." In a town where a street address reveals social class, where "showing off" is a mortal sin, where even the proper choice of words to describe feelings is rigidly circumscribed, 12-year-old Ernaux was devastated by her father's attack because "I had seen the unseeable ... we had stopped being decent people." To petit-bourgeois shopkeepers like her parents, for whom appearances were everything, such an incident was literally unspeakable--the family never discussed it. Ernaux fills that void with a pitiless portrait of provincial France circa 1952, nailing everything from its penny-pinching economies to its mean-spirited gossip and casual hypocrisies, all governed by the all-important question, "What would people think?" This is a memoir in the classic Gallic tradition: lucid, spare, impeccably reasoned and written, completely devoid of self-pity. There's not an excess word or a facile emotion anywhere in her elegant text, which compels readers' sympathy all the more forcefully by never asking for it. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>&#34;My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the early afternoon&#34;. Shame begins as the story of a twelve-year-old girl, but it is also about the storyteller, a mature woman, the author herself. The violent moment lives inside her. The trauma comes at a moment when she is still so close to her mother and father that the threatened act of violence is incomprehensible. It cuts through her like an axe. Over time, the memory cools until it is just a snapshot she carries in her purse, unchanging even after years have passed and the twelve-year-old girl has grown into an orgasmic woman and a writer. Years later the cut is still there, but her whole being has grown around it like a tree that has been struck by lightning and survived.</p><h2>Ministry of Intercessory Prayer</h2><p>This may well be Andrew Murray's most unusual and practical devotional book!<p></p><p>Besides being a rich gold mine of biblical instruction and a series of excellent prayer motivators, it is the only book he ever wrote with a built-in thirty-day study course in the practice of intercession!</p><p>Included in the latter part of this exceptional book are thirty pages of special helps for a month-long "school" in which this form of prayer is actually put into practice.

Few paid serious attention to the disturbing, profound work he was producing in his Woodstock studio. So when Ross Feld, a young novelist and critic, wrote a penetrating review of Guston's latest show, the artist sent him a letter of appreciation: "I felt...as if we knew each other and had had many discussions about painting and literature. In a word - I felt great recognition."<br>Thus began a remarkable friendship, Feld, a frequent visitor to Guston's studio where the two men would talk late into the night, became Guston's intellectual sparring partner and sounding board - "I'll shout it right out," Guston wrote to Feld, "you inspire me to paint again!" - as well as the artist's most eloquent critic and champion. Guston in Time in Feld's final tribute, and it is at once a testament to a friendship, a provocative and richly nuanced study of one of the twentieth century's most important artists, and a portrait of a remarkable character.<br>Feld illuminates Guston's key relationships, with wife Musa and composer Morton Feldman, and brings the man himself to life in all his exasperating complexity: "Omnivorous, narcissistic, brilliant, sometimes verbally fluent to the point of glibness and flattery, horridly lonely, someone for whom nothing was enough and too much at the same swamping moment." Feld's evocation of Guston's late, figurative works is equally memorable and acute.</p><p>Ross Feld is the author of four novels, a book of criticism, and a collection of poetry. His articles and criticism were widely published, and he has been awarded a Pushcart Prize as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Macdowell Colony. He lived for years in Cincinnati, where he died in May 2001.The appearance of the critic, novelist and poet Feld's engaging memoir of his late friend the painter Philip Guston (1913-1980) records a double loss, for Feld died in 2001, shortly after its completion. And although the book functions as a moving memorial to a deep and supportive friendship, Feld the critic forgoes the tired parade of anecdotes common to the personal memoir to keep a keen focus on Guston's work, especially the paintings of his last years. Scott Fitzgerald's "there are no second acts in American lives" has been disproved over and over again; Guston added a third act that was unlike anything in the history of art, American or otherwise. Beginning as a muralist in the great Mexican social realist tradition, Guston went on, as many before him, to become an abstract expressionist, but one of uncommon lyric power. But late in his career, Guston returned to figuration, employing motifs from early work (such as hooded Klan figures, now with cigars) and truncated self-portraiture (eyes, heads and enormous-footed sleeping figures) that seemed derived as much from Robert Crumb and the Sunday funnies as from the "historical tradition." Feld's readings of a number of these paintings, informed by his intimacy with the artist, are near-definitive models of passionate clarity and explication. Interwoven with these readings are similarly vivid glimpses of a troubled but lovable man, and the friends-including Philip Roth, composer Morton Feldman and poet Clark Coolidge-whose devotion to Guston is equally palpable. The book is valuable, too, for the light it sheds on the often ill-understood reciprocal nature of the relationships between artists and critics. For just as it is clear that for Guston Feld's articulate support was crucial, Guston's responses to Feld's criticism and other work seems just as important. Guston himself is abundantly present, not only in Feld's reminiscences and the well-chosen illustrations, but in the many letters to Feld that are included. Such generosity is typical of this remarkable volume, which recalls Rilke's "Letters on Cezanne" in its joyful intensity. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lucado Life Lessons Study Bible</h2><p><p><b>Discover the life-enriching biblical application you're searching for in <i>The Lucado Life Lessons Study Bible</i>.</b> With more than 1,000 "Life Lessons" offering insights straight from Max, the message of God's Word will be more meaningful and impactful than ever. </p><p>This beautifully designed Bible contains practical application drawn from Max Lucado's entire career-from his first book to his latest release, <i>Outlive Your Life</i>.

Hohn's accidental odyssey pulls him into the secretive world of shipping conglomerates, the daring work of Arctic researchers, the lunatic risks of maverick sailors, and the shadowy world of Chinese toy factories. <br><br><i>Moby-Duck</i> is a journey into the heart of the sea and an adventure through science, myth, the global economy, and some of the worst weather imaginable. With each new discovery, Hohn learns of another loose thread, and with each successive chase, he comes closer to understanding where his castaway quarry comes from and where it goes. In the grand tradition of Tony Horwitz and David Quammen, <i>Moby-Duck</i> is a compulsively readable narrative of whimsy and curiosity.</p><p><b>Donovan Hohn</b> is a journalist whose work has appeared in <i>Harper's Magazine, The New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>Outside</i>. He is currently the features editor at <i>GQ</i>. <i>Moby-Duck</i> was nominated as the runner-up for for the 2011 PEN/ E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award. Hohn lives in New York City."The book [is] by turns light-hearted and serious but always a pleasure to read ... <i>Moby-Duck</i> is highly readable and, importantly, alive with a sense of intellectual curiosity. Indeed, what Melville did for whaling, Hohn has done for plastic bath toys lost at sea." <br> -<i>The Boston Globe</i> <br><br> "Hohn cleverly uses the deceptively whimsical premise of chasing a little plastic duck to provoke a massively complicated and thought-provoking conversation. Who knew spilled bath toys could be so important?" <br> -<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> <br><br> " ... he writes always entertainingly, often gorgeously." <br> -<i>Dallas Morning News</i> <br><br> "Donovan Hohn ships out with an engaging Moby-Duck ... an exploration in every sense [Moby-Duck] will remind readers of the best of John McPhee and Ian Frazier. And maybe, even, of the weird and wonderful Herman Melville himself."<br> -<i>The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer</i> <br><br> "... entertaining but also philosophic ... [Donovan Hohn's] quest is puckish, profound and as irresistible as the yellow bath toy itself." <br> -<i>People</i> <br><br> "... dazzling ... Hohn seems to have it all: deep intelligence, a strikingly original voice, humility and a hunger to suss out everything a yellow duck may literally or metaphorically touch." <br> -<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br> "Adventurous, inquisituve and brightly illuminating...[<i>Moby-Duck</i>] works as a lively travelogue as well as a voyage of discovery and philosophical inquiry." <br> -Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "Delightfully wide-eyed...A gladdening, artful journey of discovery." <br> -<i>Kirkus</i> (starred review)</p><h2>Coppelia</h2><p>Prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn gives one last gift to the world of dance with this enchanting retelling of a classic ballet. With the vivacity and effortless grace that marked her performances, Dame Margot Fonteyn retells the story of Copp�lia, a doll so lifelike and beautiful she captures the heart of a young villager--and the jealous attention of his fianc�e. Completed shortly before her death in 1991, Dame Margot's <i>Copp�lia </i>is masterfully staged by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, whose vibrant, richly textured paintings bring to life this tale of love and the power of imagination.<br></p><p>Lou Fancher and Steve Johnson began working together as a creative team in 1986 and have collaborated on more than 50 picture books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>My Many Colored Days</i> by Dr. Seuss. They are recipients of the Society of Illustrators Gold Medal. Visit them online at www.johnsonandfancher.com.Ages 5^-8. Delibe's <i>Coppelia</i>, which was inspired by an E. T. A. Hoffman story, is a ballet particularly accessible to children. Doll maker Dr. Coppelius has created a masterpiece and dreams of bringing the realistic-looking doll to life. The doll, Coppelia, sits in the window of Dr. Coppelius' house and draws the admiration of young Franz. Franz's jealous sweetheart, Swanhilda, sneaks into the doll maker's house, dresses in the doll's clothing, and dances around his workshop. Seeing her, the doll maker at first thinks he has succeeded in bringing the doll to life but then finds that he has been deceived. Longer than previous picture-book versions of the tale, this retelling brings out the points of view of Dr. Coppelius, Franz, and Swanhilda and communicates the many dimensions of the story. An afterword fills in the history of the ballet. On each left-hand page, the text appears in a white box surrounded by a border of fabric swatches. On the facing page, a narrow white border frames a large illustration of a scene from the ballet, executed in both oil and material. Other painters have used fabric in paintings, but few have incorporated the cloth so effectively, making it part of the whole rather than an added feature stuck on as a novelty for its color, pattern, or texture. Here, the fabric is painted over in some places and in others left bare. The impressionistic paintings show the characters' personalities and moods through their bodies and gestures, rather than by facial details. Although the suggestion of music underlies the grace and movement of the characters, the illustrations show a story unfolding rather than a ballet in performance. A rich, visual interpretation and a wonderful introduction to a performance of the ballet. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Truth Imagined</h2><p>The late American longshoreman-philosopher, recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, recounts his extraordinary life and thoughts in this autobiographical memoir</p><p>Eric Hoffer--philosopher, author of the timeless tome The True Believer, and a truly great American thinker--leaves us with his memoir.

Anyone who is engaged in a creative pursuit will no doubt identify with these wonderful cartoons by award-winning artist Elizabeth Cameron of creative wannabes doing everything except actually getting down to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>"For most people creativity is a serious business," says Julia Cameron. "They forget the telling phrase 'the play of ideas' and think that they need to knuckle down and work more. Often, the reverse is true. They need to play." Ultimately, the characters in this book show us how we can turn our procrastination into play and our play into great work. With this delightful volume, Julia Cameron once again hits the nail on the head on the subject of creativity.</p></p><p><b>Julia Cameron&nbsp;</b>has been an active artist for more than three decades. She is the author of more than thirty books, including such bestselling works on the creative process as&nbsp;<i>The Artist&#x2019;s Way</i>,&nbsp;<i>Walking in This World</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Finding Water</i>. Also a novelist, playwright, songwriter, and poet, she has multiple credits in theater, film, and television, including an episode of&nbsp;<i>Miami Vice</i>, which&nbsp;featured Miles Davis, and&nbsp;<i>Elvis and the Beauty Queen</i>, which starred Don Johnson. She was a writer on such movies as&nbsp;<i>Taxi Driver</i>,&nbsp;<i>New York, New York</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Last Waltz</i>. She wrote, produced, and directed the award-winning independent feature film&nbsp;<i>God's Will</i>, which premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival, and was selected by the London Film Festival, the Munich International Film Festival, and the Women in Film Festival, among others.

If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It&#x2019;s about learning to pay attention.&#x201d;<br><b>--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place.

The West of McMurtry's own writing is wildly various, filled with dead ends and bright ideas, lonesome cowboys and garrulous socialites. In the 20 stories he's chosen for this anthology, it is instead an undifferentiated territory of losers: you've got your sad sacks, your screwups, your lost souls. The lucky have all gone to live somewhere else.<p> In any anthology, there is usually one story that rolls up its sleeves and clobbers all the others. Here it is Annie Proulx's haunting "Brokeback Mountain," the secret history of two male ranch workers who fall in love and carry on a life-long affair. Her opener also happens to give a perfect view of the landscape found in this collection: "They were raised on small, poor ranches in opposite corners of the state, Jack Twist in Lightning Flat, up on the Montana border, Ennis del Mar from around Sage, near the Utah line, both high-school drop-out country boys with no prospects, brought up to hard work and privation, both rough-mannered, rough-spoken, inured to the stoic life."</p><p> Sometimes the poverty is slicked up with romance, as in Jack Kerouac's "The Mexican Girl," a lightning-hot excerpt from <i>On the Road</i>: "Terry and Raymond sat in the grass; we had grapes. In California you chew the juice out of the grapes and spit the skin and pits away, the gist of the grape is always wine. Nightfall came. Terry went home for supper and came to the barn at nine o'clock with my secret supper of delicious tortillas and mashed beans. I lit a wood fire on the cement floor of the barn to make light. We made love on the crates." We read of Wallace Stegner's Saskatchewan, Richard Ford's Wyoming, Mark Jude Poirier's suburban Tucson. Each story thoughtfully renders disappointment. Proulx's Jack Twist says it best: "Nothin never come to my hand the right way." The writing is above reproach, the stories are compelling, but by the end of the book they seem to be all the <i>same</i> story. Surely the West is bigger than this. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><b>Larry McMurtry,</b> winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, is the author, most recently, of <i>Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,</i> as well as twenty-two novels, two collections of essays, a memoir, and more than thirty screenplays.

R. Hayden, former vice-governor of the Philippines, and Kenneth Baker of the Psychology Division of COI's Research and Analysis department. Neither had any idea what the meeting was about. After the men were seated, Wild Bill quickly came to the point: "I want you to start the schools." </p><p> "What schools?" </p><p> "The SI training schools." </p><p> "But we don't know anything about espionage schools -- " </p><p> "Who does?" </p><p> Baker and Hayden had their hands full. The newly designated Coordinator of Information (COI), later redesignated OSS, had the unprecedented task of creating a world-class intelligence organization overnight, from scratch. It was hampered by America's traditional aversion to spycraft. Unlike most of the world's great powers, America had limited experience in espionage. </p><p> The same could not be said of America's British allies. Britain's SOE (Special Operations Executive) and SIS (Secret Intelligence Service), having been at war for over two years, had all the experience necessary to lay the foundation for COI's undercover training program. The British worked with a team of COI personnel, led by Hayden and Baker, to develop a training curriculum designed to produce spies, saboteurs, and guerrillas. </p><p> While the curriculum was being written, OSS was also constructing training facilities in the Washington, D.C. area, but they wouldn't be up and running for several months. Therefore, the first COI/OSS agents trained in Canada, at "Camp X." Established by the British expressly to assist America with the shadow war, Camp X was the first secret agent training school in North America. Also referred to as Special Training School 103, Camp X was located in the countryside between the sleepy towns of Oshawa and Whitby, about thirty miles outside of Toronto. The camp was so secret that even the Canadian War Cabinet wasn't informed of its existence. </p><p> Camp X played such an important role in the war that the head of the British Security Coordination (BSC), Sir William Stephenson, described it as the "clenched fist" of all Allied secret operations in World War II. A number of notable British and American agents passed through the school. Ian Fleming is said to have drawn from the underwater frogman exercises in Lake Ontario for his James Bond character. </p><p> One of the first Americans trained at Camp X was Frank Devlin. "I was given a set of orders that read like a spook book. 'Have civilian clothes. Take train such and such to Penn Station New York and get a train to Toronto, Canada. Go to Hotel and there you will find a message with a number. That number indicates the license on the vehicle you will take and it will be at the west entrance of the hotel.' </p><p> "After I got in the vehicle, we were taken to Camp X and were enrolled as the first class. We learned night work going out. On one of our missions they told us that we had to blow part of the Canadian-Pacific railroad. There were a set of rails right before a bridge. They said that this area was completely guarded and we haven't told the guards that you are coming and they have loaded weapons. We had to rehearse it, work it out in the woods so when we did it we didn't get shot. It worked like clockwork. We planted all the charges under the rails and didn't blow it up of course but we could have done it. </p><p> "We had lots of classes on what to do if you were behind the lines. We learned all the things that could give you away. There was the use of weapons, close-up and hand-to-hand, all common today. It was all stuff that was dirty, not the kind of thing you learned in infantry school. You played dirty here. We learned how to dislocate someone's arm while you had a knife under their rib. I can still do it. If I try it I might take you and throw you over the back of that chair. Eifler [commanding officer in Detachment 101] did it to everybody. He would get their hand and do something with it, turn it in the right place. You just do a flip and you're helpless." </p><p> One of Devlin's instructors was British Captain William Ewart Fairbairn, also known as "Fearless Dan" or the "Shanghai Buster." During the twenties and thirties, Fairbairn rose to the rank of assistant commissioner of the municipal police of one of the toughest cities on earth, Shanghai. He created one of the first SWAT teams, a counterterrorist outfit known as the Reserve Unit (RU), to quell the Chinese gangs and the organized crime that ran rampant in the city. In the back alleys of Shanghai, Fairbairn developed his own revolutionary hand-to-hand fighting system, a deadly mix of jiu-jitsu and street fighting, known initially as "Gutter Fighting" and later renamed the "Fairbairn Technique." In his own words, Fairbairn described his black art. "When I organized and trained Riot Squads for the Shanghai Police I developed a system of fighting out of the methods that got results...but in modern warfare, the job is more drastic. You're interested only in disabling or killing your enemy. That's why I teach what I call 'Gutter Fighting.' There's no fair play; no rules except one: kill or be killed." </p><p> Fairbairn made a lasting impression on just about everyone he met, including OSS, who got him on more or less permanent loan from the British. OSS promoted Fearless Dan to the rank of major and transferred him to Area B, a 9,000-acre compound in the Catoctin Mountains outside Washington, D.C., the present-day site of Camp David. At Area B, Fairbairn taught his lethal hand-to-hand fighting technique, and also how to handle the Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, a razor-sharp stiletto of his personal design. </p><p> "The knife is a silent, deadly weapon. It's great for sentries. Never mind the blood. Just take care of it quickly." </p><p> After completing a course in knife fighting, the new students took a course in unarmed "Gutter Fighting." </p><p> "In a sense, this is for fools, because you should never be without a pistol or knife. However in case you are caught unarmed, foolishly or otherwise, the tactics shown here will increase your chances of coming out alive." </p><p> A technique that Fairbairn demonstrated was the "Tiger's Claw," a clenched hand that is directed at an opponent's eyes. "Deceive your opponent. Make him think you're out on your feet. Now bring the Tiger's Claw up from the cellar and put force behind it. It will knock your opponent out. But you must attack with surprise." </p><p> The Shanghai Buster gave this advice on how to counter a bear hug: "To break a bear hug...go limp...grab his testicles. Ruin him...." </p><p> When asked if the typical American trainee was reluctant to employ the "Fairbairn Technique," since it runs counter to the American sense of sportsmanship, Major Fairbairn responded: "He does have a natural repugnance to this kind of fighting. But when he realizes that the enemy will show him no mercy, and that the methods he is learning work, he soon overcomes it." </p><p> Fairbairn was joined by several other legends in hand-to-hand combat such as Rex Applegate, a crack pistol shot and the pioneer of a technique known as "offensive shooting." Applegate taught recruits how to handle a pistol in combat. "When a man is faced by an assailant who has a gun in his hand and murder in his heart, he must be able to use his pistol instantly and effectively." </p><p> COI and OSS recruited a broad variety of men and women. The common thread was creative, "out of the box" thinkers distinguished by boldness and decisiveness. One such man, Lieutenant Charles Parkin, Jr., was unceremoniously transferred to OSS from the U.S. Army Engineer School at Fort Belvoir after displaying some unwelcome initiative. </p><p> "On our way back from maneuvers I saw all of these National Guard units guarding bridges. Security was pathetic. Some units were guarding the railroad bridges with unloaded rifles or a single shotgun so I decided once I got back to Fort Belvoir to try to change things so the bridges would get proper security. I put together a plan to take my platoon to one of the bridges. First, I mentioned the plan to the officer in charge, a captain. I told him about the lack of security and that I wanted to do something about it. He said, 'Charlie, I wouldn't touch that with a ten-foot pole!' I went ahead with the plan since this was good training for my men. I wanted to show them we better get off our asses and start doing things right. </p><p> "Anyway, I called out half of my platoon that night and we rode on assault boats across the Occoquan River. These were the only railroad bridges that crossed the river into D.C. from the south. We landed and silently planted dummy explosives on the girders of the railroad bridges. It was raining that night, and to divert the guard's attention I went up and talked to him. The fake charges were set in all the right places; if they had been real explosives we could have blown the bridges sky high. When I got back to the base that morning I sat down and wrote a report of what we did and why we did it. The report went to my battalion commander and I don't know what he said but the next thing I knew I was being called to HQ with his boss. He said in essence, 'This thing is too hot to handle. The National Guard versus the Army? I'm transferring you to an outfit in Washington called the Coordinator of Information that can put your talents to use.'" Parkin soon became COI's primary demolition instructor. </p><p> One of Parkin's first recruits was his fraternity brother from Penn State, a former national wrestling standout, Frank Gleason. After the war Gleason continued a career in demolitions and special operations, retiring as a colonel and professor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. "Charlie recruited me and one of the first things he did was send me to industrial sabotage school in England run by the SOE. What they teach you at sabotage school will blow your mind. Six or seven people that are properly trained can cripple a good-sized city. It is as easy as can be. These terrorists scare me. If they know this stuff, which I'm sure they do, it's really easy to cripple a medium-size city with trained demolitionists and arsonists. We learned how to operate and destroy locomotives and power plants, the turbines in power plants, communication systems, and telephones. We also learned how to make people sick by poisoning a city's water supply. Shitty stuff like that -- we were taught how to fight dirty. </p><p> "Using a locomotive we learned how to take the controls and get the train moving at a high speed, and jump off -- creating a runaway train that would plow into something -- isn't that awful? We destroyed rolling stock by removing grease in the gearboxes and putting sugar in gasoline tanks to destroy the engines. We learned how to make explosives from sugar, from basic household supplies. How to start a fire that could take out a city. </p><p> "I knew Stanley Lovell, head of OSS R&amp;D, quite well, and he introduced me to 'Aunt Jemima.' It was a plastic explosive that looked like baking flour. The concept of it was that you could easily transport it behind the lines. In China we made muffins from the stuff. I wanted to show Major Miles how you could bake Aunt Jemima into muffins, put a blasting cap into it and blow something up. It looks like regular flour but if you look carefully at a little piece you'd see it was gritty, unlike flour. It could make bread so I told this Chinese cook at Happy Valley to make some muffins out of the explosive flour. I said, 'Do not eat those muffins! They are poison. Do not eat them!' You should have seen them when they came out of the oven, they were gorgeous. The cook thought to himself, 'Well those damn Americans want those muffins for themselves.' He violated what I told him and he ate one. He almost died." </p><p> One of Area B's early trainees was Milt Felsen, an ambulance driver and machine gunner who had fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War in the thirties. After the war Felsen went to Hollywood to produce movies, including the hit <i>Saturday Night Fever.</i> "Donovan came to the headquarters of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. We had a little place in New York City. He came up and said he wanted a half dozen or so guys to help set up the OSS. He questioned folks and chose about ten of us. He told us to meet him in Washington, which we did. </p><p> "We went to D.C. and were sent to an abandoned boy's camp, called Area B, now Camp David. </p><p> "We went up to Area B. We helped set up the place as a training base for the OSS. There were cabins and a big hall and another building we later set up as a training building. One of the things we faced was Fairbairn's house of horrors. As you entered, pop-up targets that looked like Nazis would come at you from darkened rooms. This would be accompanied by simulated gun shots and strange lights. The goal was to get off two quick shots on the targets. You had to make your way through an obstacle course which also included pop-up targets that you had to hit and keep going. </p><p> "At Area B we met Jerry Sage, our commanding officer in North Africa. He saw that we were veterans and he stuck to us. We advised him on what we thought was needed to work behind German lines. One of the things we got was a little booklet that Mao put together on guerrilla warfare. There was nothing else in those days and we had to create it. </p><p> "We did five parachute jumps. We did everything on the basis that nothing existed and we had to create it. On our jump training we jumped in different places, i.e., mountain, river, etc. We got as many weapons as we could from the Axis and other European countries. In the event we were in Europe and came across weapons they were using, we'd know what to do with them. </p><p> "We went out on a submarine. After the sub surfaced we inflated a raft on the deck and paddled to shore. Once ashore we had to hide the raft and go someplace where the people guarding the area did not know we were coming and I'm sure would be very offended and take shots at us if they discovered us. It was as realistic as it could be...maybe too realistic." </p><p> Realistic training was a hallmark for the OSS commandos, who worked in units called Operational Groups (OGs). The OGs received most of their training on the lavish 18-hole Congressional Country Club, known as Area F. "Aggressiveness of spirit and willingness to close with the enemy were stressed," so OG training was designed to be as close to reality as possible. Tragic mistakes were inevitable, as OG trainee Al Materazzi found out. "We moved to the Congressional Country Club and were trained by a Russian prince, Serge Obolensky, whose last wartime experience had been with the White Russian guerrillas. Major Fairbairn trained us in knife fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Tragically, a private accidentally killed another private during a simulation." </p><p> The first independent Secret Intelligence training school set up by OSS was RTU-11. Known as "the Farm," since it was located on a sprawling country estate about 20 miles north of Washington, RTU-11 offered elementary and advanced intelligence training.

In spite of the financial hardships of the Great Depression, Apgar was one of the first women to graduate from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. She went on to become an anesthesiologist and the school's first female professor. In 1952, she developed the Apgar score, a quick evaluation of a newborn's condition during the first critical minutes after birth. This scale has saved countless lives and is still used today.<br><br>Doctors and nurses perform the screening at 1 and 5 minutes after an infant's birth. They evaluate five vital signs--skin color, heart rate, reflexes, muscle tone, and breathing--on a scale of 0 to 2, then add up the ratings for a total ranging from 0 to 10. (Medical students often remember these signs using the mnemonic APGAR: appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration.) If the score is 7 or above, the baby is deemed in stable condition. But if it's lower, physicians and nurses will reevaluate every 5 minutes until 20 minutes have passed or until two consecutive scores of 7 or higher are recorded.<br><br>If the infant has a score of 6 or lower, some resuscitation is needed, which may involve suctioning the airway and administering oxygen. Sometimes this is because of a heart or lung condition, or another medical issue. A newborn with a score of 0 to 3 requires immediate resuscitation, usually with assisted breathing. But an initial low score may be harmless: Some babies, especially those born after a high-risk pregnancy, Caesarean section, or complicated delivery, may just take a little longer to adjust to life outside the womb. Experts say that the Apgar test isn't a predictor of a child's long-term health, unless after 20 minutes the score remains 0 to 3.<br><br>ADDITIONAL FACTS<br><br>1. At age 50, Virginia Apgar embarked on a second career. She earned a master's degree in public health and became an executive for the March of Dimes.<br><br>2. About 10 percent of newborns require medical intervention.</p><h2>Handloggers</h2><p>Adventure in the Northwest, Alaska, Logging,prospecting Memoir, wonderful wilderness stories</p><p></p><h2>The Holy Fox: A Biography of Lord Halifax</h2><p>Edward Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax, was a church-going, fox-hunting aristocrat, but it was his political guile that earned him Churchill&#39;s nickname &#39;The Holy Fox&#39;. As Viceroy of India, his deal with Gandhi ended the Civil Disobedience campaign before it could force the British to quit. His meeting with Hitler in 1937 was a milestone in appeasement, yet just days before Munich, Halifax repudiated the policy and demanded &#39;the destruction of Nazism&#39;. By May 1940, it was he, not Winston Churchill, who was the choice for Britain&#39;s war leader. Andrew Roberts has drawn on remarkable private documents to present Lord Halifax as an enigmatic, influential and much-maligned politician.</p><p>Andrew Roberts took a first in Modern History at Gonville &amp; Caius, Cambridge.

Later, The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffman startled and enchanted cinema audiences with their use of colour, form and music. In the last ten years the magic, poetry and passion of their work has been acknowledged around the world and they are firmly in the pantheon of film masters.</p><p>Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, known collectively as "The Archers," wrote, produced, and directed nearly 20 films, some of the most opulent and imaginative movies of all time. And though the makers of <i>The Red Shoes</i>, <i>Black Narcissus</i>, <i>I Know Where I'm Going</i>, and <i>A Matter of Life and Death</i> deserve to sit in the pantheon of great filmmakers, they wallow in relative obscurity. Moving effortlessly between biography and analysis, Ian Christie reveals how the Archers created their spellbinding films. After reading this book, you'll be ready to rent some of the best movies you've never heard of. The volume opens with a forward by Martin Scorsese, who describes the deep influence the Archers' movies and Powell's friendship has had over his own films.Ian Christie is a well-respected lecturer on film who has co-edited Scorsese on Scorsese, edited Gilliam on Gilliam and is the author of a study of the films of Powell and Pressburger, Arrows of Desire. Born in Queens, New York, in 1942, Martin Scorsese seriously contemplated the priesthood but finally embraced cinema and, following Mean Streets (1973) emerged as the pre-eminent American director of his generation. Taxi Driver won the Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes in 1976; Raging Bull (1980) is considered the greatest American film of its decade. During the 90s, he made GoodFellas (1990) and Casino (1995). In the past decade he has made, Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004) and Shutter Island (2010).

But this is a time when women of ability are deemed sorceresses, when Renaissance France is torn by ruthless political intrigues, and all are held in thrall to the sinister ambitions of Queen Catherine de Medici. Then a wounded stranger arrives on Faire Isle, bearing a secret the Dark Queen will do everything in her power to possess. The only person Ariane can turn to is the comte de Renard, a nobleman with fiery determination and a past as mysterious as his own unusual gifts.<br><br>Riveting, vibrant, and breathtaking, The Dark Queen follows Ariane and Renard as they risk everything to prevent the fulfillment of a dreadful prophecy&#x2013;even if they must tempt fate and their own passions.</p><p><b>Susan Carroll </b>is an award-winning romance author whose books include <i>The Bride Finder</i> and its two sequels, <i>The Night Drifter </i>and <i>Midnight Bride,</i> as well as <i>The Painted Veil, Winterbourne,</i> <i>The Dark Queen, The Courtesan, The Silver Rose, The Huntress, Twilight of a Queen, </i>and <i>The Lady of Secrets</i>. She lives in Rock Island, Illinois.The chamber lay hidden beneath the old part of the house, far from prying eyes. During Roman times, when a fortress had stood on the island, the room had been part of a catacomb of prisons, a dark place where frightened souls had been imprisoned awaiting torture and death. But that had been centuries ago.<br><br>The chains and manacles were long gone, the stone walls now lined with jars of herbs, dust-covered bottles, and books preserving knowledge forgotten by the rest of the world. The grim place had been completely transformed by feminine hands into a repository of ancient learning and a keeper of secrets. There was enough evidence stacked upon these shelves to get a woman condemned for witchcraft seven times over.<br><br>No one could have looked less like a witch than the young woman stirring the hearth&#x2019;s bubbling cauldron. Ariane Cheney was tall and thin, her slender form clad in a russet brown gown protected by the apron knotted round her waist.<br><br>The orange-red light of the torches imbedded in the walls flickered over her grave features; her thick chestnut hair was demurely bundled beneath a kerchief. Ariane had an unusually solemn face for a woman barely one and twenty, her pensive gray eyes seldom given to laughter, her lips rarely transformed by a smile.<br><br>She had little to smile about these days since her mother&#x2019;s death. With her father still missing, that left only Ariane to protect and care for her two younger sisters. Speculation grew daily that the Chevalier Louis Cheney&#x2019;s grand voyage of exploration had come to disaster, that the Chevalier was either lost at sea or killed by natives on some hostile foreign shore.<br><br>Ariane gave the contents of the cauldron one final stir, then carefully ladled some of the clear liquid into a thick clay flagon. She carried it over to the long wooden worktable. The powder she had ground rested in the bottom of the iron mortar, a concoction partly gleaned from her books, partly from her own ingenuity.<br><br>Setting the flagon down, Ariane scooped out a spoonful of the powder. She hardly knew how much to use. It was a matter of guesswork. Ariane closed her eyes and sent up a silent prayer.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, please, please let this work.&#x201d; Opening her eyes, she carefully ladled the powder into the flagon. She watched anxiously, preparing to give the potion a stir, but she never got the chance.<br><br>The reaction was immediate and violent. The liquid began to smoke and hiss, bubble and foam. As the potion roiled over the sides of the flagon, Ariane emitted a cry of dismay. She grabbed for a cloth to check the mess, but the spitting flagon forced her to retreat.<br><br>She backed away, flinging up one arm just in time as the vessel shattered, spraying the chamber with flecks of red foam and broken pottery. An acrid haze hung over the room, a sharp stench that caused Ariane to choke and her eyes to sting with tears. She flapped her cloth to clear the air and then mopped her eyes to survey the damage.<br><br>She was not hurt, but her potion had left a scorch mark on the table and burned tiny holes in her apron. Ariane had failed.<br><br>If only Maman was here to help me, Ariane thought, The familiar ache of loss tugging at her heart. It was a wish she made a dozen times every day.<br><br>Evangeline Cheney had been a true descendent of the Daughters of the Earth, as learned in the old ways as any woman who had ever lived. She had been known as a leader among wise women, the Lady of Faire Isle, a title that had passed to Ariane, but she had never felt equal to slipping into her mother&#x2019;s shoes.<br><br>It had been over two years since Ariane had watched the life ebb away from the once indomitable Evangeline. Still, not a day went by that she did not miss her mother&#x2019;s gentle strength, the wisdom of her counsel.<br><br>Oh, Maman, Ariane thought, to be able to hear your voice again. She wondered, would it really be so dreadful, to summon her mother&#x2019;s spirit, just this once? She knew well what her mother&#x2019;s answer to that question would have been. Evangeline Cheney had taught her three daughters many marvelous things, but she had solemnly adjured them against any meddling with dark magic.<br><br>Ariane forced her attention back to the mess she had made of her workshop. She had most of the broken pottery picked up when she realized that someone was shifting the trap door that concealed the way down to the hidden chamber.<br><br>&#x201c;Ariane?&#x201d;<br><br>Gabrielle&#x2019;s voice floated down to her from the regions above. Ariane had just enough time to dump the shards of pottery into the ash bin before her sister came down the twisting stone stair with all the air of a grand duchess about to make her curtsy at the royal court.<br><br>The girl had been cutting and refitting one of her old gowns again in an effort to appear more fashionable. What had once been a sweet and simple frock had been dyed carnelian and trimmed in a rich pattern of gold embroidery. The full skirts flared out over a farthingale and opened in the front to reveal a cream-colored underskirt frothing with lace. But it was the bodice Ariane eyed with misgiving, cut too low and displaying far too much of Gabrielle&#x2019;s generous bosom.<br><br>As she descended the stairs, Gabrielle lifted her skirts, managing to keep the gown clear of any stray dust with one elegant twitch of her hand. Her hair was of fairest gold, her face noted for its alabaster complexion, full red lips, and jewel-blue eyes.<br><br>She was so perfectly lovely that it often made Ariane&#x2019;s heart ache to look at her. Perhaps because she missed the days when Gabrielle had not been quite so concerned about her appearance, when her little sister had torn about Faire Isle barefoot, her curls in a flyaway tangle, a smudge of paint on her cheek, as she had demanded a fresh canvas to work upon. Her hands had been callused, her nails broken from her latest effort at sculpting.<br><br>Now Gabrielle&#x2019;s hands were soft, her nails perfectly manicured. It was her eyes that seemed in danger of turning hard and brittle.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, there you are. I have been looking for you everywhere,&#x201d; she complained. Gabrielle rarely visited the hidden workshop and Ariane was disturbed to realize that she had not made any effort to close the concealing door above them.<br><br>&#x201c;Gabrielle, I do trust that you remember this is supposed to be a secret room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is not as if all our servants don&#x2019;t know that the room is here and that we are witches.&#x201d;<br><br>When Ariane frowned at her, Gabrielle rolled her eyes and amended, &#x201c;Oh, pardon me, I forgot. Witches is a bad word. I should have said wise women.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what about any chance visitor?&#x201d; Ariane demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;There is no one here. Not unless you count your noble suitor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What! Renard is here?&#x201d; Ever since Ariane had awakened that morning to discover the mist burned off the island, she had feared his return.<br><br>&#x201c;Just teasing,&#x201d; Gabrielle grinned.<br><br>Ariane recovered her breath. &#x201c;Blast you, Gabrielle. It is nothing to jest about. You know I have been dreading the comte&#x2019;s return.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, well, if you will persist in rescuing these stray men&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was lost in the woods. All I did was point him to the right path,&#x201d; Ariane retorted. The first time she had met Renard was on the mainland and he hadn&#x2019;t seemed frightening or intimidating, only a man who had lost his way in the woods. The Deauville forest covered many acres and could be a treacherous place, full of wild boar and the occasional wolf. Ariane had simply led him back to safety.<br><br>She had fully expected that to be the end of the matter, never dreaming that the next time she saw Renard, he would coolly inform her that he had selected her to be his comtesse and he was arranging their wedding. Ariane had puzzled over Renard&#x2019;s actions so much, it threatened to bring a permanent crease between her eyes.<br><br>Gabrielle noticed the familiar frown gathering on Ariane&#x2019;s brow. &#x201c;Oh, do stop worrying, Ariane. After the wedding gift we sent Monsieur le Comte&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The gift you sent,&#x201d; Ariane corrected. &#x201c;You should not have done it, Gabrielle. I don&#x2019;t think it was wise to insult the comte.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pooh! Insults are the only way to be rid of a man as overbearing as Renard. I doubt he&#x2019;ll trouble you again.&#x201d;<br><br>Gabrielle&#x2019;s prank of the straw bride might have temporarily forestalled the comte, but Ariane feared that Renard, like the Deauvilles before him, was not a man to be easily defied.<br><br>Ariane turned to clean up the rest of the potion spattered across the table. As it cooled, it turned darker, assuming the appearance of spilled blood.<br><br>Gabrielle sashayed around Ariane, glancing down at the mess and wrinkling her nose. &#x201c;What in the name of all the saints have you been doing down here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing of any success. I was trying to develop a potion to add to the soil and hopefully double our grain crop this year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought Maman said we should never attempt to perform black magic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is science,&#x201d; Ariane lifted the sopping rag and tossed it into the dustbin. Gabrielle peered at the scorch mark on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;It looks to me like the kind of science that destroys crops instead of growing them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t seem able to get the formula right, but I have to do something to generate more funds.&#x201d;<br><br>Funds that were badly needed to pay off the debts their father had left and insure that her sisters had dowries if Papa did not return. But that was not something that ever concerned Gabrielle.<br><br>She shrugged. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you try turning lead into gold instead of attempting to burn the house down?&#x201d;<br><br>Ariane glared. Repenting of her teasing, Gabrielle sidled closer to wrap her arm around Ariane&#x2019;s shoulders and give her a light hug.<br><br>&#x201c;Your fretting is going to give you permanent wrinkles. I have told you before, a woman&#x2019;s fortune is in her face. You would be better off trying to develop some new skin creams. I could certainly use a new perfume.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another perfume is the last thing you need, Gabrielle. I remember a time when you were far more interested in concocting new shades of color for your palette.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Maltese Falcon</h2><p>A classic of its genre.</p><p>Sam Spade, Dashiell Hammett's archetypally tough San Francisco detective, is more <i>noir</i> than <i>L.A. Confidential</i> and more vulnerable than Raymond Chandler's Marlowe. In <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, the best known of Hammett's Sam Spade novels (including <i>The Dain Curse</i> and <i>The Glass Key</i>), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment.<p> Spade's partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can't provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Who has it? And what will it take to get it back? Spade's solution is as complicated as the motives of the seekers assembled in his hotel room, but the truth can be a cold comfort indeed.</p><p> Spade is bigger (and blonder) in the book than in the <i>movie</i>, and his Mephistophelean countenance is by turns seductive and volcanic. Sam knows how to fight, whom to call, how to rifle drawers and secrets without leaving a trace, and just the right way to call a woman "Angel" and convince her that she is. He is the quintessence of intelligent cool, with a wise guy's perfect pitch. If you only know the movie, read the book. If you're riveted by <i>Chinatown</i> or wonder where Robert B. Parker's Spenser gets his comebacks, read the master. <i>--Barbara Schlieper</i></p>"Dashiell Hammett. . . is a master of the detective novel, yes, but also one hell of a writer." --<b>The Boston Globe</b><br><br>"<b>The Maltese Falcon</b> is not only probably the best detective story we have ever read, it is an exceedingly well written novel."--<b>The Times Literary Supplement</b> (London)<br><br>"Hammett's prose [is] clean and entirely unique.

The experience had a profound effect on him, and 23 years later, now a respected journalist and established golf writer, Lorne Rubenstein returned to Dornoch to spend an entire summer. With his wife, he rented a flat in the very centre of town, mere steps from the golf course, and enthusiastically set out to explore. <i>A Season in Dornoch</i> is the account of that summer. <br> <br>Rubenstein writes about the melancholy history of the Highland Clearances, and the friendly, sometimes eccentric, people who love their town, their golf, and their single-malt whisky, and delight in sharing them with visitors that they recognize as kindred spirits. But most of all he writes about a summer lived around <br>golf, in a community where golf is king ? and the golf course is part of the common lands where townspeople stroll of an evening. <br> <br>The golf played here is links golf, and the course is shaped by weather as much as by man. The fairways curve amongst gorse and rough windblown grasses, and the bunkers are cut deep into the turf. Playing here, Rubenstein, like all links golfers, is less in control, and so, gradually, begins to relax, to return to golf as play, as opposed to a game of analysis and effort. <br> <br> <i>A Season in Dornoch</i> is an affectionate portrait of a place and the people who live there, a fascinating look at links golf and the spirit and skills it calls forth, and a perceptive and ultimately moving memoir of one man?s quest to experience once again the pure love of sport that he knew in his youth.<b>Lorne&nbsp;Rubenstein</b> is an award-winning golf columnist for <i>The Globe</i> and <i>Mail,</i> Canada's national newspaper. He is the author of eight books, most recently <i>The Fundamentals of Hogan</i> (with David Leadbetter), and his work has appeared in <i>Golf Digest, Golf Magazine, Esquire,</i> and many other publications around the world. He lives in Toronto and Jupiter, Florida, with his wife, Nell.</p><h2>A Short Method of Prayer &amp; Other Writings (Hendrickson Christian Classics)</h2><p>A Short Method Of Prayer &amp; Other Writings (Hendrickson Christian Classics)</p><p></p><h2>How to Knit (Usborne Art Ideas)</h2><p>Offers a step-by-step tutorial in the techniques of casting on, knitting, purling, and casting off, and presents a series of projects designed to introduce more advanced stitches.</p><p>&#39;How I wish this book had been available when I learnt to knit&#39; - School Librarian Journal; &#39;A great companion for the novice knitter.

Forrest's The Emergence of Greek Democracy (1966). The book is a lively and thoughtful chronicle of the years leading up to and into the great war between the Athenians and Spartans. Pericles is cast as the tragic hero whose flaw is the very rationality with which he so skillfully guided the Athenians and forged an empire. Contrary to the charges of both ancient and modern critics, Kagan argues that the democracy was a rational, deliberate, and moderate regime, and Pericles is portrayed as the consummate visionary political leader whose great mistake was to expect everyone to think and behave as rationally as he did.

I was a bag of nerves. The MC didn&#x2019;t speak for very long, but it seemed to take forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I wanted to jump up and say. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get on with it!&#x201d;<br> <br>The longer he talked, the more nervous I got. At last, he began to wrap up his remarks.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay,&#x201d; I told myself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sure, it was a kids&#x2019; talent show in North Carolina. Yes, my daughters were the ones performing, not me, but that didn&#x2019;t make me any less fidgety. Finally, the MC stopped talking and the curtains opened. Then my youngest girls, Isabella and Sophia, came out and sang &#x201c;My Favorite Things&#x201d; from The Sound of Music. &#x201c;Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens.&#x201d; I love that song. And even though I was such a wreck, the girls sung beautifully. On the outside, I may have come across as cool and collected, but inside I was a mess.<br> <br>All my life, people have always told me, &#x201c;You look so comfortable,&#x201d; whether it was on the football field or hosting a television show or any of the other things I&#x2019;ve done in between. If they only knew. The truth is, I&#x2019;m a shy guy. I get nervous for myself and I get nervous when someone I love is out there on the line. But I&#x2019;ve known ever since I was young how to take that nervous energy and turn it into positive energy. My goal in this book is to share with you what I&#x2019;ve learned about developing a winning attitude and putting your most productive habits to work to craft the life of your dreams. I&#x2019;ve had more than a few jobs, challenges, and personal transformations to which I&#x2019;ve applied my philosophy, which I share with you in the pages that follow. Beyond my own experiences, throughout the book, I turn to other experts and people who&#x2019;ve thought deeply and written about the power of positive thinking and transformation, from happiness expert Shawn Achor to Po Bronson, from Thor Muller and Lane Becker to Dr. Joseph Cardillo, an expert on energy management, to the figures who&#x2019;ve meant so much in my life, from my dear friend Dr. Ian Smith to the late, great Giants coach Earl Leggett. In the second half of the book I talk specifically about how to use these principles not only to reach your goals but also to transform your attitude. In ways that may be counterintuitive, former professional athletes know a thing or two about transformation. Our career choices are, by definition, limited in duration. We can play only as long as our bodies, first and foremost, and our willpower allow us to. Then we have to reinvent ourselves.<br> <br>Using stories from my own life and from those whose journeys have inspired me, I draw upon the power of positive thinking often. Take the time the producers of Good Morning America approached me about joining the team. I was scared to death. I was just getting my sea legs on LIVE with the talented Kelly Ripa and didn&#x2019;t think I could handle sitting at a news desk with esteemed journalists like George Stephanopoulos and Robin Roberts. Then I had to ask myself, &#x201c;Well, am I not trying it because I&#x2019;m afraid or is it because I think I can&#x2019;t do it?&#x201d; After some reflection, I admitted to myself that I was afraid of trying and failing, and that wasn&#x2019;t a good enough reason not to give myself a chance.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s a recent example of my working through my fear, but it&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve been doing since I was a child, even when it comes to football. I don&#x2019;t remember the first time I ever held a football any more than I remember being handed my first bottle of milk. The youngest of six, with three older brothers and two sisters, I was surrounded by football enthusiasts. My brothers loved football. My parents loved football. Before I could walk or crawl properly, I could hold a football.<br> <br>My brothers and I were always good at the game. It wasn&#x2019;t so much that we were innately talented as that we persevered. When I was seven years old, our family lived on an army base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where my father, Gene Strahan, served as a captain in the military. I still remember how excited I was to begin my first season on the Pee Wee Falcons team and the pride I felt in seeing that black-and-white uniform laid out on the bed. From the first time I donned a football uniform, I&#x2019;ve loved the ritual of putting on the game pants with the built-in pads and the eyelet front. Then the shoulder pads with elastic bands and metal clips that make a distinctive sound when they&#x2019;re fastened.<br> <br>I had watched my brothers do it a hundred times, but nothing had prepared me for the power and pride I felt the first time it was my turn. With my pads and my helmet on, I walked onto the field feeling like a gladiator, and an aerodynamic one at that. The sport may be brutal, but the design of the equipment is elegant, simple, and beautiful. Someday, if we ever get those flying suits that they used to talk about on cartoons like The Jetsons, I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll be calling some of the engineers who design football uniforms. My team had a special chant, which I took pride in every time I sung it and which still makes me smile when I think about it. &#x201c;What do Falcons do? Swoop, swoop, swoop.&#x201d; The fall I entered second grade, there was no day better than Saturday, when my mother laid out my uniform and I put on my equipment and I would swoop, swoop, swoop around the field.<br> <br>One afternoon at a game, I made what I remember was the most amazing play of my Pee Wee career. An opposing player did a sweep around the opposite side and was headed for the goalpost. It was such an unexpected move that no one was even close to being able to stop him. He was twenty yards in front of me, but I ran him down and tackled him. The parents from our team went crazy, setting the bleachers afire, it seemed. My teammates were jumping up and down, screaming my name&#x2014;all of which terrified me as I went crying back to the huddle. When I say crying, I don&#x2019;t mean that cinematic cry, just a few tears of happiness running down my cheek. I was doing an ugly cry: it was a bawling, snot-coming-out-of-my-nose, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my mama? &#x2019;Cause I need her&#x201d; cry. Thank God I had a helmet; it not only protected my head but also managed to hide the tears.<br> <br>I learned something huge about myself that day. I loved making the play, but I did not like the attention. In time, I learned something else about myself: fear of being in the spotlight didn&#x2019;t stop me from pursuing what produced the fear in the first place; I pursued football nonetheless. Do I still get anxious? Of course. Intimidated? More than you know. As they say, Show me the boy at seven and I&#x2019;ll show you the man. But I&#x2019;ve learned on the field that I can push through it. And I&#x2019;ve been pushing through it ever since. The protective gear I wear these days is more mental than material. Gone are the shoulder pads and helmets. Instead, I employ what you can think of as attitude adjustments that help me play through the fear. I truly believe there&#x2019;s more power in your attitude than in your bank account. That&#x2019;s true for all of us, from the single mom struggling to build a brighter future for her kids to thought leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs.<br> <br>I have spent my entire career sprinting down that thin line between what&#x2019;s impossible and what&#x2019;s improbable. Along the way, I&#x2019;ve learned how to turn self-doubt into an energy source and to metabolize fear into a result-producing adrenaline. When I was in college and really learning the art of football, I became so good at making plays and upsetting the other teams&#x2019; offense on the field that the other teams began to assign two players to cover me instead of the customary one. The local reporters called this &#x201c;Strahan Rules,&#x201d; as it was an uncommon practice that seemed to be implemented only for me. Throughout this book, you&#x2019;ll see my own live-your-best-life rules. Don&#x2019;t think about any of these as something that&#x2019;s being dictated for you to follow. But rather these rules are my way of giving you that extra oomph so you can carry your dreams all the way to the finish line. In a perfect world, I&#x2019;d have ninety-two rules to match my jersey number. But in real life, I&#x2019;ve found that you need only eighteen to get and stay motivated. I share those eighteen with you in the chapters that follow and sum them up in the appendix.<br> <br>When considered together, my hope is that the &#x201c;Strahan Rules&#x201d; will help you transform your attitude so you can accomplish your goals. I was having a conversation with a friend recently. We were talking about how it is that some people seem able to drive toward their goals with so much joy, while for others it&#x2019;s struggle after struggle and setback after setback. All I know is that for as long as I can remember, I saw life as a game, a puzzle that I could solve again and again to get and achieve the things I wanted the most. I never&#x2014;well, rarely&#x2014;allowed myself to be overcome by doubt. I just kept telling myself, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get there somehow.&#x201d; Did I know the exact method or route to achieve my dreams? Absolutely not. But I created a set of tools&#x2014;rituals, ideas, formulas that helped me get from there to here&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what a lot of this book is about.<br> <br>Even now when people say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re successful, you can have anything you want,&#x201d; I think, &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; No matter what we accomplish, we&#x2019;re always searching for something else. I&#x2019;m not talking about money or material things. I just think we have an innate desire, as human beings, to continue to achieve. Achievement, the quest and the process of doing more and being more, is the most powerful pathway to happiness.<br> <br>Everything people ever want is because, at the core of it, they believe that it will make them happy. The goal could be a relationship, a house, or a career. But I&#x2019;ve learned that happiness is, in and of itself, a choice you make every day. Every morning I ask myself, &#x201c;How do I get to happy today?&#x201d; Then I keep asking questions: Is happiness freedom? Is it honesty? Is it the passion you feel when you&#x2019;re doing something you love? Is it feeling wanted? Is it feeling needed? Is it giving and being of service? Or is it all of those things?<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time asking myself these questions because, while I work extraordinarily hard and I play hard too, I want to make sure that I&#x2019;m spending the limited time and energy I have on the things that make me happy.<br> <br>Life changes every day, every minute. You&#x2019;re thrown things that don&#x2019;t seem fair at times; you&#x2019;re thrown things that you don&#x2019;t know how you&#x2019;re going to handle, or if you can even bear to handle them. But happiness is something that you have to find every single day. It&#x2019;s not a &#x201c;Been there, done that.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not &#x201c;Well, I finished the happiness test and I got an A and now I&#x2019;m moving on to the next thing.&#x201d; The quest for happiness is an ongoing pursuit, maybe the most important test of our lives. Because at the end of your life, if your stack of happy days is bigger than your stack of miserable days, then yours was a life well lived. It&#x2019;s that simple.<br> <br>My goal with Wake Up Happy is to set you up for the win in your own life, no matter how many obstacles appear to be in the way. To quote lyrics sung by the legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday, &#x201c;The difficult I&#x2019;ll do right now. The impossible will take a little while.&#x201d; So let&#x2019;s get started.</p><h2>The Adventures of Big-Foot Wallace, the Texas Ranger and Hunter (Classics of the Old West)</h2><p><br>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

In a light, jaunty baritone Boyd Gaines captures the light-hearted Archy McNally, who has been expelled from Yale Law for streaking and is acting for a third time as problem-solver for friend and foe. Gaines flattens his tone and broadens a Midwestern accent to create the local sheriff. For the villains he sharpens his voice. The women&#39;s voices are softer and breathy and, in one case, loaded with a Southern accent. The variety in Gaines&#39;s delivery enables the listener to identify the characters quickly and to delight in the details of Palm Beach society. M.G.S (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Scriptorium: Poems (National Poetry Series)</h2><p><b>A collection of poems exploring questions of religious and linguistic authority, from medieval England to contemporary Appalachia</b><br><br><b>A National Poetry Series winner, selected and with a foreword by Tracy K. Smith</b><br><br>The poems in <i>Scriptorium</i> are primarily concerned with questions of religious authority. The medieval scriptorium, the central image of the collection, stands for that authority but also for its subversion; it is both a place where religious ideas are codified in writing and a place where an individual scribe might, with a sly movement of the pen, express unorthodox religious thoughts and experiences. In addition to exploring the ways language is used, or abused, to claim religious authority, <i>Scriptorium</i> also addresses the authority of the vernacular in various time periods and places, particularly in the Appalachian slang of the author&#x2019;s East Tennessee upbringing. Throughout <i>Scriptorium</i>, the historical mingles with the personal: poems about medieval art, theology, and verse share space with poems that chronicle personal struggles with faith and doubt.</p><p><b>Melissa Range</b> is the author of the poetry collection <i>Horse and Rider</i> (Texas Tech University Press, 2010) and the recipient of awards and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Antiquarian Society, the Sewanee Writers&#x2019; Conference, the Fine Arts Work Center (Provincetown, MA), and the Rona Jaffe Foundation. Originally from East Tennessee, Range currently lives in Wisconsin and teaches at Lawrence University.&#x201c;Range&#x2019;s poems show an expertise with form from sonnets to anagrams...A collection not to be missed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;She avoids both folksiness and stuffiness by filling poems with incident, description, elegy, meditation, recollection, identification, and more...This book is going to dazzle a lot of poetry readers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;This collection, as fiercely contemporary as it is historical, is both unapologetically literary and egalitarian as hell. It&#x2019;s poetry that is truly &#x2018;...for everyone / like language, like color, like air.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Birmingham Poetry Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Scriptorium</i>, lush with musicality, is perhaps more sophisticated for its restraints, and her deft formal touch remains on display with sonnets, terza rima, ghazal, cento, and villanelles.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Appalachian Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Throughout <i>Scriptorium</i>, Range finds the poetic in the colloquial, the past in the present, the transcendent in the immanent. Perhaps her most impressive achievement, however, is her ability to turn engagement with the long history of metrical form in English into a foundation for strikingly innovative poetic technique.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Cat Fitzpatrick, <i>The Boston Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Each of the poems in <i>Scriptorium</i> is a marvel. What may likely strike you on the first read is Range&#x2019;s remarkable facility with form. She moves nimbly, naturally, with comfort and acrobatic delight through the rigors of sonnets, villanelles, anagrams, cento and the like...But what you will feel more than any of this, I am certain, is an urgent usefulness. These are poems for which form is not an end in itself.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Tracy K. Smith, from the foreword<br><br>&#x201c;Poetry is ongoing revelation, the spirit surging in new words and shapes, in fresh forms. Yet rarely have I had such a vivid sense of this as while reading <i>Scriptorium</i>. This is revelatory poetry of a high order. Range has a finely tuned ear, a furtive and fertile imagination, and a gloriously rooted sense of that great word-hoard, the English language itself.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jay Parini, author of <i>New and Collected Poems, 1975-2015</i></p><h2>The Practice of the Presence of God: Conversations and Letters of Brother Lawrence</h2><p>This remarkable collection of the thoughts of a seventeenth-century Carmelite friar records the simple wisdom of a man who constantly felt God&#39;s companionship.</p><p><i>At any moment and in any circumstance, the soul that seeks God may find Him, and practice the presence of God.<br><br></i>Brother Lawrence, a seventeenth-century French monk, learned to practice the presence of God at all times. And you can, too. Here in one volume are two classic works by Brother Lawrence. Each book reveals how to practice God's presence and see His glory in every facet of your life. <br><br><i>The Practice of the Presence of God </i>is a collection of documented conversations and letters that reveal the heart of this humble man. He wrote, "The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen . . . I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament." <br><br>Brother Lawrence's wisdom and spiritual insights have helped bring people closer to God for more than three centuries. <i>The Spiritual Maxims of Brother Lawrence, </i>a lesser known but equally outstanding work, is a summary of his teachings. Throughout, he develops one great theme, best expressed by the psalmist, "In Thy Presence is fulness of joy."Nicholas Herman of Lorraine, better known as Brother Lawrence, was born in 1611 of humble origin. First serving as a soldier, he entered the Carmelite Order in Paris at the age of 55 and became a cook. He died in 1691 at the age of 80, honored by all who knew him.</p><h2>Ms. American Pie: Buttery Good Pie Recipes and Bold Tales from the American Gothic House</h2><p><b>Beth M. Howard</b> knows about pie. She made pies at California&#x2019;s Malibu Kitchen for celebrities including Barbra Streisand (lemon meringue), Dick Van Dyke (strawberry rhubarb), and Steven Spielberg (coconut cream) before moving back home to rural Iowa. She now lives in the famous American Gothic House (the backdrop for Grant Wood&#x2019;s famous painting) and runs the hugely popular Pitchfork Pie Stand.&nbsp;With full-color photos throughout, <b>Ms. American Pie </b>features 80 of Beth&#x2019;s coveted pie recipes and some of her own true tales to accompany them. With chapters like Pies to Heal, Pies to Seduce, and Pies to Win the Iowa State Fair, Beth will divulge her secret for making a killer crust without refrigerating the dough and will show you how to break every rule you&#x2019;ve ever learned about making delicious, homemade pie.</p><p>Basic Pie Dough for Single-Crust Pie <br>View larger <p><b></b></p> <b>Basic Pie Dough for Single-Crust Pie</b> <p></p> <p>"Fear of making pie dough is the number one reason people run to the store for pre-packaged pie dough and frozen pie. I feel it&#x2019;s my personal mission to help these would-be bakers by sharing some of my confidence-building guidelines. It&#x2019;s just pie. You don&#x2019;t need a culinary school degree or any kind of degree at all to make it. All you need is desire, a few pointers, and some encouragement to break the rules!"</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Before You Begin:</b> <p></p> <p>Contrary to what other cookbooks will tell you, extra flour will not make your dough tough; adding flour to your rolling surface will keep your dough from sticking&#x2014;and will keep you from running to the store in frustration to buy pre-made pie crust. Always start from the center and roll out to the edges, rolling in one direction. Keep your workspace clean and take the time to scrape the gunk off your rolling surface as well as your rolling pin. When rolling dough, use your pie dish to calculate how big you&#x2019;ll need it, allowing for enough extra width to account for the depth of the dish and make sure the extra inch or two of overhang from the dish has enough bulk for crimping the edge. Size isn&#x2019;t the only goal when rolling dough&#x2014;you want to aim for a certain &#x201c;thinness. &#x201d;</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Directions:</b> <p></p> <p>1. In a deep, large bowl, work the butter and shortening into the flour and salt with your hands until you have almond- and pea-sized lumps of butter. 2. Then, drizzling in ice water a little at a time, &#x201c;toss&#x201d; the water around with your fingers spread, as if the flour were a salad and your hands were the salad tongs. Don&#x2019;t spend a lot of time mixing the dough, just focus on getting it moistened. Translation: With each addition of water, toss about four times and then STOP, add more water, and repeat. 3. When the dough holds together on its own (and with enough water, it will), do a &#x201c;squeeze test. &#x201d; If it falls apart, you need to add more water. If it is soggy and sticky, you might need to sprinkle flour onto it until the wetness is balanced out. The key is to not overwork the dough! It takes very little time and you&#x2019;ll be tempted to keep touching it, but don&#x2019;t! 4. Now divide the dough in two balls (or three, if your pie dishes are smaller) and form each into a disk shape. 5. Sprinkle flour under and on top of your dough to keep it from sticking to your rolling surface. Roll to a thinness where the dough almost seems transparent.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <b>Ingredients:</b> <p></p> <ul> <li>� cup (� stick) butter, chilled and cut into large chunks</li> <li>� cup vegetable shortening, chilled</li> <li>1� cups flour, plus at least � extra for rolling</li> <li>Dash of salt</li> <li>Ice water (fill a � cup but use only enough to moisten dough)</li> </ul>Beth M.

This superb and original book is the reality behind Greenmantle&#39; Norman Stone The Berlin-Baghdad Express explores one of the big, previously unresearched subjects of the First World War: the German bid for world power - and the destruction of the British Empire - through the harnessing of the Ottoman Empire. McMeekin&#39;s book shows how incredibly high the stakes were in the Middle East - with the Germans in the tantalizing position of taking over the core of the British Empire via the extraordinary railway that would link Central Europe and the Persian Gulf. Germany sought the Ottoman Empire as an ally to create jihad against the British - whose Empire at the time was the largest Islamic power in the world. The Berlin-Baghdad Express is a fascinating account of western interference in the Middle East and its lamentable results. It explains and brings to life a massive area of fighting, which in most other accounts is restricted to the disaster at Gallipoli and the British invasions of Iraq and Palestine.</p><p>Sean McMeekin has written two previous books, both published by Yale University Press: The Red Millionaire and History&#39;s Greatest Heist: The Looting of Russia by the Bolsheviks. He splits his time between the USA and Turkey.In this excellent, well-researched and fascinating book, Sean McMeekin has given us a welcome and stimulating perspective on a highly important but neglected part of the First World War. His account of the Turco-German war effort is a tale of high adventure, ambition and political chicanery with a cast of colourful, brave and sometimes ruthless characters. -- Lawrence James * Literary Review * An exciting new book by a talented young historian -- Niall Ferguson * Observer * McMeekin adds a wealth of documentation...[t]he result is a captivating new history of the Eastern Front in the first world war -- Eugene Rogan * Financial Times * McMeekin has written an engaging history peopled with larger-than-life characters in exotic settings -- Eugene Rogan * Financial Times * McMeekin has written a powerful, overdue book that for many will open up a whole new side to the first world war. -- George Walden * Observer * In addition to bringing to life a fascinating episode in early 20th-century history, The Berlin-Baghdad Express contains several timely lessons and cautionary tales. * Wall Street Journal * Sean McMeekin&#39;s account possesses the large merit that it tells a story little known to Western readers, drawing extensively upon German sources. It depicts a splendid cast of characters heroic in their endeavors if absurd in their lack of accomplishments. -- Max Hastings * New York Review of Books *</p><h2>Island of the Mighty</h2><p>Island of the Mighty retells the last branch of the Mabinogion, the story of Gwydion, Arianrhod, Llew Llaw Gyffes, Blodeuwedd and Goronwy. It begins with a retelling of stealing the pigs belonging to Lord Pryderi. Gwydion uses this to provoke war, allowing his younger brother to rape the king&#39;s footholder. This also leads to the death of Pryderi, which doesn&#39;t endear Gwydion to the reader who has also read the retellings of the other three branches -- and also to the disgracing of Arianrhod and the birth of Llew Llaw Gyffes.</p><p></p><h2>Sculpture, Form, and Philosophy: The Notebooks of Alexander G. Weygers</h2><p>It'�?s not often that a master artist puts pen to paper to describe in detail his theory of and approach to art. SCULPTURE, FORM, AND PHILOSOPHY is a rare treat, a glimpse into the mind and technique of a true artistic genius. Alexander Weygers began his career as an engineer and, through schooling and private apprenticeship, slowly developed into a multi-disciplined artist, with a focus on sculpting. His later years were spent compiling the illustrations, photographs, and text that would describe his life'�?s work. As a teacher himself, he meant the book to be a hands-on instructional aid that would also encourage students to delve into the philosophy behind their art. In this, Weygers has succeeded, for SCULPTURE, FORM, AND PHILOSOPHY delivers a personal, practical, and philosophical discussion of the fine art of sculpting.&#x201a;Ģ Features detailed descriptions of tools needed for plaster, stone, and wood carving.&#x201a;Ģ Includes analysis of 19 of Weygers'�?s sculptures, giving insight into the technique and composition that went into their creation.</p><p>�Features detailed descriptions of tools needed for plaster, stone, and wood carving. <p>�Includes analysis of 19 of Weygers&#x2019;s sculptures, giving insight into the technique and composition that went into their creation.</p>ALEXANDER G.

After a lifetime of being a sculptor, blacksmith, wood engraver, inventor, engineer, photographer, illustrator, designer, machinist, carpenter, toolmaker, mentor, and beekeeper, he passed away in 1989, in Carmel Valley, California, where he had made his home and studio for almost 50 years.</p><h2>Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P.

Readers will find his wilderness experiences captivating: encountering grizzly bears, moose, wolverines; outwitting and eventually dispatching a murderous trapper; adjusting to the harsh climate and inhospitable terrain; building a remote cabin in which he later lived with his wife and children. The book is a fine piece of nostalgia, a picture of camaraderie and pioneering at a time when Alaska was the frontier. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hatfield provides a true story of pioneering and adventure. He tells it so well because it is his own. In 1933, he left his home state of Maine, traveled across the United States, and finally settled in the Alaskan wilderness. He remained in Alaska for 40 years. His understanding of the wilderness and its animal residents is evident throughout the tale: "If a man says he knows everything about grizzly bears he's simply dead wrong, for no man does. . . .

His first show came in 1975 at the Blum Helman Gallery, and was followed in 1977 by the landmark installation of elephant carcasses, burned diaries, taxidermy, African artifacts, books and personal memorabilia at New York&#39;s International Center for Photography. In addition to creating original artwork, Beard has also worked as a Vogue photographer and collaborated on projects with Andy Warhol, Andrew Wyeth, Richard Linder, Terry Southern, Truman Capote, and Francis Bacon. In 1996, shortly after Beard was trampled by an elephant, his first major retrospective took place at the Centre National de la Photographie in Paris, France, followed by shows in Berlin, London, Milan, Stockholm, Tokyo, and Vienna, among others.

This beautifully written collection contains some of his most touching stories yet. By examining the seemingly insignificant incidents of life a chance encounter with a boy on a bicycle, a visit to a local school to watch a young girl&#x2019;s graduation he shows readers how to look below the surface and find deeper meanings. He calls on readers to listen for the quiet spiritual messages of everyday existence that he calls "God&#x2019;s whispers." Crafting stories from common experiences, Nerburn reveals lessons for the soul and opens windows to the heart. Few writers are so capable of moving gently over deep waters. And few give such poignant glimpses into the hidden grace of ordinary days.</p><p>Following up on the inspirational messages of his earlier books (<i>Small Graces</i>, etc.), Minnesota writer and sculptor Nerburn shares the lessons he has absorbed through ordinary experiences. Whether listening to bird calls on a trip to Oxford, England; observing a man without legs in a wheelchair flying a kite"; or engaged in conversation with an elderly man in a gym locker room, the author feels the presence of God in every encounter. Nerburn's gentle spirituality and strong religious faith carry him through the many difficult moments he shares. When an adolescent asks him for change for something to eat, the author overcomes his initial resistance by recalling the gospel passage, "I was hungry and you gave me to eat." Although Nerburn initially waves away the beggar's thanks, he comes to realize that it is important for him to accept in return. As the only white person at a Native American funeral for a former student killed in an accident, the author becomes immersed in cultural traditions that, while not his own, unite him with the mourners in a moment of shared comprehension. These reflective writings should appeal to those who share Nerburn's values and beliefs. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Central to Sayers&#39;s reflections is the conviction that both men and women are first of all human beings and must be regarded as essentially much more alike than different. We are to be true not so much to our sex as to our humanity. The proper role of both men and women, in her view, is to find the work for which they are suited and to do it. Though written several decades ago, these essays still offer in Sayers&#39;s piquant style a sensible and conciliatory approach to ongoing gender issues.</p><p>One of the first women to graduate from Oxford University, Dorothy Sayers pursued her goals whether or not what she wanted to do was ordinarily understood to be "feminine."

Its children are raised in company houses -- three rooms upstairs, three rooms downstairs. Its ball club leads the coal company league. The twelve Baker mines offer good union jobs, and the looming black piles of mine dirt don't bother anyone. Called Baker Towers, they are local landmarks, clear evidence that the mines are booming. Baker Towers mean good wages and meat on the table, two weeks' paid vacation and presents under the Christmas tree.</p><p>The mines were not named for Bakerton; Bakerton was named for the mines. This is an important distinction. It explains the order of things.</p><p>Born and raised on Bakerton's Polish Hill, the five Novak children come of age during wartime, a thrilling era when the world seems on the verge of changing forever. The oldest, Georgie, serves on a minesweeper in the South Pacific and glimpses life beyond Bakerton, a promising future he is determined to secure at all costs. His sister Dorothy, a fragile beauty, takes a job in Washington, D.C., and finds she is unprepared for city life. Brilliant Joyce longs to devote herself to something of consequence but instead becomes the family's keystone, bitterly aware of the opportunities she might have had elsewhere. Sandy sails through life on looks and charm, and Lucy, the volatile baby, devours the family's attention and develops a bottomless appetite for love.</p><p><em>Baker Towers</em> is a family saga and a love story, a hymn to a time and place long gone, to America's industrial past and the men and women we now call the Greatest Generation. This is a feat of imagination from an extraordinary new voice in American fiction, a writer of enormous power and skill.</p></p><p>Jennifer Haigh's first novel, <i>Mrs. Kimble</i>, was an auspicious debut about three women who marry the same man--consecutively--and their ability to kid themselves about who he is, and, more to the point, who they are. It won the PEN/Hemingway Award, given annually for best first fiction. Haigh has beaten the sophomore slump with another page-turner: <i>Baker Towers</i>. The action, such as it is, takes place in post-World War II Bakerton, a Pennsylvania mining town. "...[T]he town's most famous landmark, known locally as the Towers, two looming piles of mine waste. They are forty feet high and growing... The mines were not named for Bakerton; Bakerton was named for the mines. This is an important distinction. It explains the order of things. Haigh lets us know this on page two, setting the backdrop for the family drama of the Novaks. <p> The story begins with the death of Stanley Novak, wife of Rose and father of Georgie, Dorothy, Joyce, Lucy, and Sandy. This is an Italian-Polish marriage, tolerated, but a break with the town's tradition. The personality, temperament and needs of all five Novaks are made clear to us by their choices--although they are not always clear to the Novaks. Their interaction, with each other and their community, is the stuff of the novel. Life revolves around the mines, the Church, gossip, and sports. Many times throughout the book it seems that Haigh is using a camera rather than a pen, so perfectly does she create a scene for the reader. </p><p> Georgie struggles to get away from Bakerton after his military service by going to Philadelphia and marrying the boss's daughter, a decision he lives to regret. Dorothy gets a job in D.C., but never really fits into the scene. A breakdown brings her home for good. Joyce joins the military, is appalled by the way she is treated, and hastens home to care for her ailing mother. Lucy, overweight and unwelcome with the "in" crowd, longs to be Fire Queen, the pinnacle of acceptance in Bakerton. Sandy, handsome and unreliable, leaves for big city life, finds it, and comes home periodically to hide out. </p><p> Haigh has captured these people's lives as they play out, more acted upon than acting. None of the Novaks is self-reflective; the girls accept the status quo, the boys escape and find that they have taken themselves with them. A foreshadowing of the changes that will take place is symbolized by a horrific mine explosion at the end of the book. This life that Haigh has so carefully described will soon disappear forever, for good or ill, but she has illuminated its current reality with a sure hand. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><p>Jennifer Haigh is the author of the short-story collection <em>News from Heaven</em> and four critically acclaimed novels: <em>Faith, The Condition, Baker Towers</em>, and <em>Mrs. Kimble</em>.

Dougherty, The Catholic University of America </p><p>"The lectures that were the basis for <i>Man and the State</i> were delivered at the University of Chicago at a time when Maritain was still in the first enthusiasm of his participation in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He devotes particular attention to the concept of rights, since, historically, rights theories were fashioned to supplant the natural law theory to which Maritain as a Thomist gives his allegiance. Maritain provides an ingenious and profound theory as to how natural law and natural rights can be complementary. For this reason alone it remains a fundamental contribution to political philosophy, but it is filled with other gems as well. Was Maritain too optimistic in his appraisal of modernity? Or have we unjustly lost the optimism that was his? <i>Man and the State</i> is an invitation to rethink the way we pose the basic questions of political philosophy."&#x2015;Ralph McInerny, Jacques Maritain Center, University of Notre Dame</p><br><p></p><br><br><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p><br><br><p>Jacques Maritain (1882-1973), distinguished French Catholic philosopher and writer, was the author of more than fifty books.

The children there were tenderly sheltered from the outside world, brought up to believe they were special, and that their personal welfare was crucial. But for what reason were they really there? It is only years later that Kathy, now aged 31, finally allows herself to yield to the pull of memory and try to make sense of the past. What unfolds is an extraordinarily powerful story in which Kathy, Ruth and Tommy slowly come to realise that it is their seemingly happy childhood that has haunted them ever since, even tainting their adult lives. Part love story, part mystery, &#34;Never Let Me Go&#34; is a uniquely beautiful and troubling novel, charged throughout with a profound emotional depth.</p><p>All children should believe they are special. But the students of Hailsham, an elite school in the English countryside, are so special that visitors shun them, and only by rumor and the occasional fleeting remark by a teacher do they discover their unconventional origins and strange destiny. Kazuo Ishiguro's sixth novel, <i>Never Let Me Go</i>, is a masterpiece of indirection. Like the students of Hailsham, readers are "told but not told" what is going on and should be allowed to discover the secrets of Hailsham and the truth about these children on their own.<p> Offsetting the bizarreness of these revelations is the placid, measured voice of the narrator, Kathy H., a 31-year-old Hailsham alumna who, at the close of the 1990s, is consciously ending one phase of her life and beginning another. She is in a reflective mood, and recounts not only her childhood memories, but her quest in adulthood to find out more about Hailsham and the idealistic women who ran it. Although often poignant, Kathy's matter-of-fact narration blunts the sharper emotional effects you might expect in a novel that deals with illness, self-sacrifice, and the severe restriction of personal freedoms. As in Ishiguro's best-known work, <i>The Remains of the Day</i>, only after closing the book do you absorb the magnitude of what his characters endure. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human. <br>Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it. <br>Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it's only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is. <br>Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>The Undercliff: A sketchbook of the Axmouth - Lyme Regis Nature Reserve</h2><p>The Undercliff.

Previous books on the topic of Hawaiian quilts acknowledge that patchwork quilting came to Hawaii in 1820 and that the large applique form of Hawaiian quilting was established in 1880. The shift from one form of quilting to the other is monumental. But, the design evolution over those sixty years has eluded most authors before now. Most acknowledge that information on that time period seems to be nonexistent. Hawaii&#39;s major museums only have two quilts from the mid-nineteenth century. Records from this time period are scarce, and many are only recently being translated into English from native Hawaiian. Dr. Arthur delves into this patchwork and successfully stitches the important missing pieces together to bring to life the complete history of Hawaiian quilting.</p><p>Linda Boynton Arthur is Professor of Apparel Merchandising, Design, and Textiles at Washington State University and Curator of its Historic Textiles and Costume Collection.

In 1970, Stephen B. Oates wrote what has come to be recognized as the definitive biography of Brown, a balanced assessment that captures the man in all his complexity. The book is now back in print in an updated edition with a new prologue by the author.</p><p>Stephen B. Oates is Paul Murray Kendall Professor of Biography at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His most recent book is <i>A Woman of Valor: Clara Barton and the Civil War.</i> His other books include <i>With Malice Toward None: The Life of Abraham Lincoln</i>; <i>Let the Trumpet Sound: The Life of Martin Luther King Jr.</i>; and <i>Our Fiery Trial; Abraham Lincoln, John Brown, and the Civil War Era.</i> He is the editor of <i>Biography as High Adventure: Life Writers Speak on Their Art.</i>"The most objective and absorbing biography of John Brown ever written. Its title captures perfectly Brown's own conception of his role in the antislavery crusade. Oates describes with subtlety and detail John Brown's early career, his struggles with poverty, illness, and death, the desperate straits the man was put to in support of his large family of twenty children. . . . To Oates's credit he describes John Brown's crimes [at Pottawatomie Creek] as unflinchingly as he describes his hardships."&#x2015;<i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"Brown's life was filled with drama, and Oates tells his story in a manner so engrossing that the book reads like a novel, despite the fact that it is extensively documented and researched."&#x2015;Eric Foner, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"A major work, based on research in a wide variety of sources, including some manuscript collections not available to previous biographers. It is a full-scale biography that treats in detail Brown's career before he went to Kansas and his actions in that territory, as well as the blazing climax at Harpers Ferry."&#x2015;<i>Saturday Review</i></p><h2>Genesis</h2><p>This book is the first time in over 20 years that Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel and Mike Rutherford have collaborated creatively on a project, working together to create the complete history of Genesis.

With his eye-catching artwork and his mature storytelling skills, the young creator returned the Caped Crusader to his gritty urban roots. In Adams' talented hands, Batman matured into "the Dark Knight"--a transformation that still resonates with fans to this day. Not only did Adams energize his peers and delight readers, but his work unquestionably inspired future iterations of Batman--in comics and in the movies.</b><br><br>Now all of Neal Adams' seminal Batman work--covers and stories--is being collected in chronological order!

He attended Manhattan's High School of Industrial Art and, while still a student, found work ghosting the <i>Bat Masterson</i> syndicated newspaper strip and drawing gag cartoons for Archie Comics. Neal received his own comic strip based on the popular TV series <i>Ben Casey</i> in 1962. The strip ran until 1965 at which time Neal made the move to comics for Warren Publishing and DC Comics. Neal's realistic style on <i>Deadman</i> and <i>Green Lantern/Green Arrow</i>, at odds with the more cartoony comics of the day, made him an immediate star. He became DC's premier cover artist, contributing radical and dynamic illustrations to virtually the company's entire line. Neal's work has also appeared in Marvel's <i>X-Men, The Avengers,</i> and <i>Thor</i>, on paperback book covers, and on stage, as the art director for the Broadway science fiction play, <i>Warp</i>. In the 1970s, Neal and partner (and frequent inker) Dick Giordano started the art agency Continuity Associates out of which came, in the 1980s, Continuity Comics. Neal is the winner of several Alley, Shazam, and Inkpot Awards, and was inducted into the Harvey Awards' Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999.&#x201c;There was no artist in the era that was more distinctive or dynamic than the man who brought an especially evocative commercial art sensibility to Batman.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>The World&#39;s Greatest Bible Trivia for Kids: The Who?

He continued that teaching nationally in his best-selling books, Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire and Fresh Faith, which told about the transforming power of God&#x2019;s love to convert prostitutes, addicts, the homeless, black people, white people, professional people, and working people. Now Cymbala continues to spread the word about the power of God&#x2019;s Holy Spirit in the lives of people who seek Him. Fresh faith is available to His church as God&#x2019;s people desire the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s constant infilling. Cymbala&#x2019;s newest book talks about what it really means to be Spirit filled, both as individuals and as the church. The Book of Acts is the basis for his study as Cymbala delves into what it was like for Christians back in the first century&#x2014;and what it can be like for them today. The first century church believed in God&#x2019;s Word, in the constant infilling of His Spirit, and in the clear and direct responses of obedience to the scripture which defined the norm for their daily and spiritual lives. Cymbala shows that same life in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit is available to us today for pastors, leaders, and lay people who are longing for revival.</p><p>Jim Cymbala, pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, must be one fantastic sermon-giver. He's got it all: great storytelling skills, the willingness to be humble and vulnerable as he admits his owns frailties, an excellent command of Bible passages, and the ability to weave it all together into a spiritual shawl that warms the soul long after the words have ended. In <i>Fresh Power</i>, Cymbala once again draws upon his life and the lives of his church members to bring forth a new lesson. This time Cymbala speaks to how Christians can embrace the biblical meaning of "Holy Spirit" and follow the words of the scripture to revitalize their faith as well as their church.Jim Cymbala has been pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle for twenty-five years.

She lives with her husband on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.</p>Like a box of chocolates, this short novel by McCullough is seductive and satisfying; readers will want to devour it in one sitting. Set in the early 1900s in the tiny town of Byron, nestled in the Australia's Blue Mountains, it tells of the blossoming of Missy Wright, 33-year-old spinster and poor relation of the town's ruling family, the Hurlingfords. Missy, her widowed mother and crippled aunt live in genteel poverty, victims of the Hurlingford inheritance policy that gives riches and power to the male members of the family, who heartlessly abuse the women they dominate. Plain, painfully thin and doomed to dress always in serviceable brown, shockingly dark-haired in a clan of luminous blondes, Missy seems fated for da dreary future until a distant cousin, a divorcee, arrives from Sydney. Under her tutelage, Missy acquires spunk, hope and the means to a happy ending. This is an endearing tale, exuding an old-fashioned sentimentality, yet wittily told. McCullough indulges in gentle social satire, even as she uses the stock character of a mysterious stranger to introduce suspense and romance. As miniaturized in scale as The Thornbirds was vast, this first volume in Harper's new Short Novel Series again demonstrates the author's narrative skill. 100,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; Reader's Digest Condensed Books selection; Literary Guild alternate; author tour. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Be as You are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi</h2><p>HARD TO FIND</p><p></p><h2>Claudia and the Bad Joke (The Baby-sitters club)</h2><p>Even though Claudia&#39;s baby-sitting responsibility Betsy is known for her practical jokes, Claudia isn&#39;t worried.

Andrea di Robilant&#x2019;s tale takes us back to the time of Josephine Bonaparte, as well as into some of the most delightful rose gardens in Italy today, brought to colorful life on the page in the watercolors of artist Nina Fuga.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his 2008 biography of the Venetian lady Lucia Mocenigo (his great-great-great-great- grandmother), di Robilant described a pink rose that grows wild on the family&#x2019;s former country estate, mentioning its light peach-and-raspberry scent. This passing detail led to an invitation for an audience with a local rose doyenne, Eleonora Garlant. She and other experts wondered if di Robilant&#x2019;s unnamed rose could possibly be one of the long-lost China varieties that nineteenth-century European growers had cultivated but which have since disappeared. On the hunt for the identity of his anonymous yet quietly distinctive rose, Di Robilant finds himself captivated by roseophiles through time&#x2013;&#x2013;from Lucia and her friend Josephine Bonaparte to the gifted Eleonora, whose garden of nearly fifteen hundred varieties of old roses is one of the most significant in Europe&#x2013;&#x2013;and by the roses themselves, each of which has a tale to tell. <br><br> What starts out as a lighthearted quest becomes a meaningful journey as di Robilant contemplates the enduring beauty of what is passed down to us in a rose, through both the generosity of nature and the cultivating hand of human beings, who for centuries have embraced and extended the life of this mysterious flower.</p><p><p><b>Guest Review of &#x201c;Chasing the Rose,&#x201d; by Andrea Di Robilant </b></p><p></p><p><b>By John Casey</b></p><p></p> <p><strong>John Casey was born in 1939 in Worcester, Massachusetts, and educated at Harvard College, Harvard Law School, and the University of Iowa.

Andrea di Robilant has written something just as wonderful. He is fluent in at least three languages and has an amazingly detailed knowledge of history (Napoleon and Josephine play a part), but it is Andrea's enthusiasm and alert open-heartedness that make <i>Chasing the Rose</i> as full of incidents and personages as the most engaging novel.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrea di Robilant was born in Italy and educated at Columbia University, where he specialized in international affairs.

Instead, William H. Sherman presents Dee in a fresh context, revealing that he was a well-connected adviser to the academic, courtly, and commercial circles of his day.</p><p>William H. Sherman is assistant professor of English at the University of Maryland, College Park."Innovative, meticulous, and beautifully produced. . . . By resituating John Dee in his library, Sherman has demystified the magus and offered us a completely new figure&#x2015;no longer the eccentric practitioner of a muddled Hermetic philosophy, but a scholarly agent of the commonweal."&#x2015;<i>(London) Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"An impressive reassessment of John Dee. . . . Dee himself is fascinating, and through him Sherman raises broader questions about how we read the past and the role of the intellectual within the Tudor patronage system. A model of clear, jargon-free writing, the book is highly recommended."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"Sherman's book is superb. It is unusually learned, strikingly original, and always surprising. Not merely is this our most subtle and suggestive account of the writings of the protean John Dee, it is also a work that calls into question our most entrenched convictions about reading and writing in early modern England."&#x2015;David Scott Kastan, Columbia University<br><br>"A model monograph, elegantly conceived, lucidly written, and astonishingly learned. Sherman has acquired a mastery of libraries and manuscripts, and an understanding of the ways of early modern writers, scribes, and publishers that would do credit to a grizzled veteran. More important still, he has the originality and wit to mobilize his erudition in the service of a clear, original, and important thesis."&#x2015;Anthony Grafton, Princeton University</p><h2>Websters&#39; First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language: Websters&#39; First New Intergalactic</h2><p>From rear cover notes: &#34;This long-awaited Work is a Wild and humor-filled Source Book of New Words and Weird essays for Wise Women.

A gaggle of young lasses, all of whom had donned elegantly arching swan masks, strolled by in a flock. He grinned at them, disrupting the formation and sending them, honking in feminine tones, toward the refreshment table.</p> <p>&#x201c;Stop that, ye devil.&#x201d;</p> <p>Arran glanced over at his brother, seated a few feet away and in deep conversation&#x2014;or so he&#x2019;d thought&#x2014;with an elegant owl mask. &#x201c;I didnae do a thing but smile. Ye said to be friendly, Ranulf.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ranulf, the Marquis of Glengask, shook his head. Even with his face partly obscured by a black panther half-mask, there wasn&#x2019;t likely a single guest at the Garreton soiree tonight who didn&#x2019;t know precisely who he was. &#x201c;I said to be polite. Nae brawls, nae insults, and nae sending the wee Sasannach lasses into a frenzy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then likely I should&#x2019;ve worn a cow or a pigeon mask, instead of a fox.&#x201d; Or perhaps he shouldn&#x2019;t have attended at all tonight&#x2014;but then who would keep a watch for Campbells and other unsavory sorts?</p> <p>The owl beside his brother chuckled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the disguise would matter, Arran,&#x201d; she said in her cultured English accent. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d still make all the young ladies sit up and take notice.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I suppose that to be a compliment, Charlotte,&#x201d; he returned, inclining his head at his oldest brother&#x2019;s Sasannach fianc�e, Charlotte Hanover, &#x201c;so I&#x2019;ll say thank ye.&#x201d; At that same moment he spied a splendid peacock mask above a deep violet gown and smiled, but the expression froze as the green and gold swan beside the peacock came into view. <i>Damnation</i>. The two young birds joined arms and turned in his direction, but he didn&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d spotted him yet. &#x201c;Yer bonny sister wouldnae be a swan tonight, would she?&#x201d; he asked Charlotte, slowly straightening from his lean against the wall.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Charlotte returned. &#x201c;Poor thing. I don&#x2019;t think she realized so many others would be wearing swan masks tonight, as well.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, if ye see her and Winnie, tell the lasses I said hello,&#x201d; he said, turning for the door to the main ballroom. &#x201c;I spy Uncle Myles, and I ken he wanted a word with me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Liar,&#x201d; Ranulf said. &#x201c;And dunnae go far. The Stewarts are expected tonight, and I want ye to make Deirdre Stewart&#x2019;s acquaintance.&#x201d;</p> <p>Arran stopped dead, though he did duck a bit to stay behind the clutter of masks between him and the green-gold swan. &#x201c;Deirdre Stewart? The hell ye say.&#x201d;</p> <p>His older brother didn&#x2019;t look like he was jesting, however. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard she&#x2019;s pleasant enough, and she&#x2019;s but two-and-twenty. And she&#x2019;s the Stewart&#x2019;s niece.&#x201d;</p> <p>So that was the other reason his brother had told him to stay in London, even after the brawls and his obvious&nbsp;&#x2026; impatience with the rather English way Ranulf had been conducting himself. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my duty now, is it?&#x201d; he asked, unable to keep the growl from his voice.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve nae met Lord Allen&#x2019;s daughter, so I suppose we&#x2019;ll find oot.&#x201d; The marquis glanced beyond Arran&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Yer pretty bird is close by.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jane Hanover was more like a vulture, circling and waiting for him to succumb to her relentless charm, but Arran wasn&#x2019;t about to stand there and argue while she closed in. He didn&#x2019;t need to wear a fox mask to sense trouble, and Charlotte&#x2019;s eighteen-year-old sister was nothing but. His own sister Rowena&#x2019;s dearest friend or not, she was a debutante, a Sasannach, and a romantic. Arran shuddered, glancing over his shoulder. Devil take him before he let himself be caught up with that.</p> <p>And then, evidently, there was clan Stewart. There&#x2019;d been no open warfare between the two clans, and now that he thought about it, over the past week his brother had mentioned them more often than he had the Campbells. And though this was the first time Ranulf had spoken about him and Deirdre in the same sentence, Arran had had more than a hunch it was coming. Politically an alliance would likely fare better if Ranulf himself offered for Deirdre, but as the chief of clan MacLawry had gone and fallen in love with a Sasannach, Arran supposed that left to him to be the sacrificial MacLawry. And so he could only hope the lass more resembled her mother than she did her frog-faced father, and he could be grateful that no other lass in particular had caught his eye before now.</p> <p>Off to his left the music for the evening&#x2019;s first waltz began, shaking him back to his present peril. Damnation. Jane Hanover would track him down, inform him that she had no partner for the dance, and he would have to be polite because they were about to become in-laws. Before the music finished he would find himself betrothed&#x2014;and that would throw a bucket of sour milk into Ranulf&#x2019;s plans, not to mention his own.</p> <p>A peacock and swan hurried through the doorway behind him. And by God he wasn&#x2019;t yet fool enough to end up leg-shackled to a fresh-faced debutante who found him &#x201c;ruggedly handsome.&#x201d; Saint Bridget, he didn&#x2019;t even know what that meant. Sidestepping between two groups of guests, he turned again&#x2014;and walked straight into a red and gold vixen half-mask.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sir Fox,&#x201d; she said, a surprised smile curving her mouth below the mask.</p> <p>&#x201c;There he is, Jane!&#x201d; he heard his sister, Winnie, exclaim.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lady Vixen,&#x201d; he returned, matching her smile with one of his own. &#x201c;I dunnae suppose ye&#x2019;d care to dance this waltz with one of yer own kind?&#x201d;</p> <p>Shadowed green eyes gazed at him for a half-dozen heartbeats, while his doom moved in behind him. One of his dooms. How many of them was a man of seven-and-twenty supposed to shoulder? &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be delighted, Sir Fox,&#x201d; the vixen said, saving him with not even a moment to spare.</p> <p>He held out his hand, and gold-gloved fingers gripped his. Moving as swiftly as he could without dragging her&#x2014;or giving the appearance that he&#x2019;d fled someone else&#x2014;he escorted her out to the dance floor, slid his hand around her trim waist, and stepped with a vixen into the waltz.</p> <p>His partner was petite, he noted belatedly, the top of her head just brushing his chin. And she had a welcoming smile. Other than that, she might have been Queen Caroline, for all he knew. Or cared. She wasn&#x2019;t Jane Hanover, and at the moment that was all that mattered.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are we to waltz in silence, then?&#x201d; she asked, London aristocrat in her voice. &#x201c;Two foxes among herds of swans and bears and lions?&#x201d;</p> <p>Arran grinned. &#x201c;When I looked at the dessert table I was surprised nae to see baskets of corn for all the birds.&#x201d;</p> <p>She nodded, her face lifted to meet his gaze. &#x201c;Poor dears. Evidently Lady Jersey wore a particularly lovely swan mask to this same soiree last year, and it prompted something of a frenzy.&#x201d;</p> <p>As she glanced about the crowded ballroom, he took her in again. Petite, slender, light green eyes, and hair&nbsp;&#x2026; He wasn&#x2019;t certain what color to call it. A long and curling mass straying from a knot, it looked like what would result if a painter ran a brown-tipped brush through gold and red in succession&#x2014;a deep, rich mix of colors that together didn&#x2019;t have a name.</p> <p>He blinked. While he&#x2019;d been known to wax poetic, he generally didn&#x2019;t do so over a Sasannach lass&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;Why is it that Lady Vixen didnae already have a partner fer a waltz?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I only just arrived,&#x201d; she returned in her silky voice. &#x201c;Why was Sir Fox fleeing a peacock?&#x201d;</p> <p>So she&#x2019;d noticed that. &#x201c;I wasnae fleeing the peacock. That bird&#x2019;s my sister. It&#x2019;s the swan who terrifies me.&#x201d;</p> <p>The green gaze held his, and he found himself wishing he could see more of her face. As a Highlander and a MacLawry, his ability to assess someone&#x2019;s expression swiftly and accurately had saved his life on several occasions. An abrupt thought occurred to him. Ranulf had said the Stewarts were attending this evening. What if this vixen was Lady Deirdre? Was she taking his measure as much as he wished to take hers?</p> <p>&#x201c;All swans,&#x201d; she countered, &#x201c;or just that one? Do they not have swans in the Highlands?&#x201d;</p> <p>Of course she knew where he was from; even if all of Mayfair hadn&#x2019;t been buzzing about the MacLawrys brawling their way through drawing rooms over the past few weeks, his brogue would have made it fairly obvious. Unlike his sister, Rowena, he made no attempt to disguise or stifle his accent. Being a MacLawry was a matter of pride, as far as he was concerned. &#x201c;Aye, they do have swans there, though nae many. It&#x2019;s easier to avoid them in the Highlands, where a lad knows the lay of the land and there&#x2019;s more space to maneuver.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I had no idea swans were so deadly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aye. They&#x2019;ll catch hold of ye when ye&#x2019;re nae looking, and they mate fer life.&#x201d;</p> <p>She laughed. &#x201c;Unlike foxes?&#x201d;</p> <p>Did foxes mate for life? He couldn&#x2019;t even recall at the moment. After a fortnight spent hunting for more human dangers, both male and female, a discussion of wildlife&#x2014;even an allegorical one&#x2014;seemed&nbsp;&#x2026; refreshing. &#x201c;This fox is nae looking for a thing but a partner for the waltz,&#x201d; he returned, smiling back at her. There. If this was Lady Deirdre, she now knew he wasn&#x2019;t pursuing some other lass. &#x201c;And the vixen?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I was looking for a friend of mine. An interlude with a fellow fox is an unexpected&nbsp;&#x2026; distraction. And if you say something flattering, I won&#x2019;t even be insulted that you only asked me to dance in order to avoid a bird.&#x201d;</p> <p>Was that a cut? Or a jest? The fact that he couldn&#x2019;t be certain of which it was intrigued him. Sassanach lasses in his experience and with very few exceptions knew all about the weather and could discuss it for hours, but he couldn&#x2019;t give them credit for much else. &#x201c;Someaught flattering,&#x201d; he mused aloud, trying to decide how much effort to go to. He meant to approach a marriage agreement from a position of strength, after all. True, perhaps he didn&#x2019;t dread the notion as much as he had five minutes earlier, but he wasn&#x2019;t ready to surrender. Not by a long space. A MacLawry didn&#x2019;t beg for an alliance. &#x201c;Ye dance gracefully,&#x201d; he settled on.</p> <p>She laughed again, though it didn&#x2019;t sound as inviting, this time. &#x201c;Well. Believe it or not, you aren&#x2019;t the first Scotsman to say so. You measure quite equally with the lot of them.&#x201d;</p> <p>Arran was fairly certain he&#x2019;d just been insulted. He hid a scowl, not that she&#x2019;d be able to see it behind the fox mask. If she <i>was</i> Deirdre, perhaps he needed to be more&nbsp;&#x2026; charming, or some such. Though she might have introduced herself before she began pecking at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve known ye fer two minutes, lass,&#x201d; he commented, pulling her a breath closer. &#x201c;I weighed saying ye had a lovely pelt and gracefully pointed ears, but I didnae ken ye&#x2019;d appreciate that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And why wouldn&#x2019;t a vixen like to hear that a fox admires her pelt?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Because ye&#x2019;re nae a vixen, any more than I&#x2019;m a fox. Ye chose nae to wear a swan mask, which at least sets ye apart from a dozen other lasses here tonight, but I&#x2019;m wearing a fox mask because my sister handed it to me. I reckon I&#x2019;d rather be a wolf, truth be told.&#x201d; Yes, the family generally called him the clever one, and Rowena had seemed pleased enough at the choice that he&#x2019;d gone along with it, but it was a well-painted piece of papier-m�ch�&#x2014;and nothing more.</p> <p>&#x201c;I wanted to be a vixen,&#x201d; she said after a moment. &#x201c;My father wanted me to be a swan.&#x201d;</p> <p>Now <i>this</i> was interesting. &#x201c;And yet here ye are, nae a swan.&#x201d; She also was a young woman, perhaps three or four years older than Rowena&#x2014;the age he knew Deirdre Stewart to be&#x2014;with an attractive mouth, lips that seemed naturally to want to smile, and shadowed green eyes that he imagined crinkled at the corners. If Arran hadn&#x2019;t had both hands occupied with the waltz, he would have been fighting the urge to remove her mask, so he could see the whole of her face, to know if the parts were equal to the sum.</p> <p>Her lips curved again. &#x201c;And <i>that</i> is a compliment, Sir Fox.&#x201d; She tilted her head, the gold lights in her hair catching the chandelier light. &#x201c;Or do you wish me to call you Sir Wolf?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d answer to Arran,&#x201d; he returned, grinning back at her. She didn&#x2019;t react to his name, but then she likely already knew who he was. London Society didn&#x2019;t boast many lads fresh from the Highlands.</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell me why the swan&#x2014;the one pretending not to gaze at you from over by the refreshment table&#x2014;terrifies you, Arran,&#x201d; the vixen said.</p> <p>He shrugged. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s my sister&#x2019;s closest friend, and my oldest brother is betrothed to <i>her</i> sister.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; the vixen returned, her lush gold and red gown swirling against his legs. &#x201c;The moment she discovered her future brother-in-law had an unmarried brother, she began dreaming about a double wedding.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aye. Someaught like that. I&#x2019;ve nae wish to break her heart, but I&#x2019;ll nae end up marrying her to avoid seeing her pout, either.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You must be quite the dancer, if your waltz causes ladies to become spontaneously engaged. Someone should have warned me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tease if ye like, lass, but I&#x2019;m nae here to get tangled into a debutante&#x2019;s fairy tale.&#x201d; God and Saint Bridget knew there were more than enough bonnie lasses awaiting his pleasure in the Highlands, and none of them with silly Sasannach sensibilities about romance and danger. When Ranulf, the chief of clan MacLawry, married his English bride, the family would have more than enough gentle southern blood brought into the mix. And evidently he was to be aimed at a Stewart, anyway.</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not here to marry, then what brings you to London? The mild weather?&#x201d;</p> <p>Arran snorted. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s nae someaught that can knock ye to yer knees, it&#x2019;s nae weather. I&#x2019;m only here to keep an eye on my brother and sister. And to be polite.&#x201d;</p> <p>He sent a glance over where the big black panther waltzed with his owl. With Ranulf distracted by a pair of pretty hazel eyes and Rowena enamored of everything English, one of the MacLawrys needed to keep a wary eye open for Campbells. That was why he&#x2019;d left their youngest brother, Bear, behind to see to Glengask while he rode down to London. Because William Campbell declaring that clan Campbell would recognize a truce with the MacLawrys was just words. Very fragile ones. Arran had seen enough bloody deeds to recognize the difference.</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2018;To be polite&#x2019;?&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;An&nbsp;&#x2026; interesting goal. Are you generally not polite, then?&#x201d;</p> <p>It likely wasn&#x2019;t a coincidence that she&#x2019;d several times now decided to comment on the most barbed portion of his various statements. She was needling him&#x2014;and on purpose. He liked it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a very polite lad,&#x201d; he said aloud, &#x201c;except to those who dunnae deserve a kind word.&#x201d;</p> <p>Amused green eyes looked up to meet his gaze again. &#x201c;And where do I fall in this hierarchy?&#x201d; she asked.</p> <p>Whoever this lass was, she was no timid flower. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;ve some Highlands blood in yer veins, do ye nae, lass?&#x201d;</p> <p>She lowered her head for a heartbeat. &#x201c;I do, at that. But what makes you say so?&#x201d;</p> <p>With a crescendo the waltz ended. Arran stood there for a moment, briefly wishing he hadn&#x2019;t named himself the designated watchdog of his family. Then he would have been free to continue this conversation somewhere more intimate. &#x201c;Save me a quadrille or someaught, and I&#x2019;ll tell ye,&#x201d; he offered instead.</p> <p>She belatedly untangled herself from his arms. &#x201c;I would, but there are enough men here that that wouldn&#x2019;t be&nbsp;&#x2026; seemly. Another time, perhaps?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aye. Another time. But at least tell me yer name, lass.&#x201d;</p> <p>A slow smile curved her attractive mouth once more, and this time the muscles across his abdomen tightened in respons...</p></p><h2>Cugel&#39;s Saga</h2><p>The roguish Cugel the Clever is stranded on a shore on the other side of the world by the Laughing Magic and must fight, bluff, and connive his way back to Almery to take vengeance on the wizard</p><p>Jack Vance is one of the greats of science fiction.

I strained hard against my chains, leaning over a guy to see out the plane's window. A wild storm was building over Oklahoma City, our final destination. Lord, please just let this plane crash was my silent prayer. The storm seemed like an opportunity for an easy exit from life. I was through with it. <br><br>Growing up in Nebraska I had seen enough poached green clouds to know the most beautiful sky is the one about to kill you. As a kid I had often heard the town's tornado siren and scampered to the top of the roof to see for myself, watching horned monsters form in the clouds until Mom shouted me down. My brothers and sisters and I would huddle with her under the splintered stairway of our basement, safe in her embrace. My mother, I think, liked the drama of those moments. <br><br>Over the years I'd given her plenty of that. <br><br>Under the stairs was probably the only time she felt in control of her three headstrong boys; my two sisters were well behaved. <br><br>Dad's red rusted toolbox was down there. I saw it in my mind when I thought of that basement. On one of my bank jobs I had borrowed it just to drop it a few feet to the shiny floor tiles. The bang was loud enough to draw everyone's attention. That's how the first bank robbery began, a year and a half earlier--already a lifetime ago.<br><br>In the plane, downdrafts were rattling our chains and bucking us around like a two-dollar state fair ride. I was nervous enough just to be going where I was going--federal prison. <br><br>If Marty Barnhart still wanted to pray for me, this would have been a good time, I thought. Marty was the pastor of our church, and when my downward slide had first started, my parents had asked him to come visit me in county jail, where I was staying after buying beer for my barely underage brother. Marty came because he had been asked to, but also--I could see it in his face--because he sensed I was on the brink of something a lot worse.<br><br>Marty held my hands through the bars and prayed for me. Little did he know I had already robbed one bank and would rob four more. I liked him, but I figured I was too far gone for his medicine.<br><br>My hometown of David City is an hour and a half due west of Omaha, or forty-five minutes northwest of Lincoln, the home of the Cornhuskers football team--football being the state's second religion. The land is mostly flat. Modest hills of corn, grass, and soybeans rise just enough to spoil your view of the Empire State Building and the Golden Gate Bridge. Those hills play havoc with the crop pivots, which are quarter-mile-long steel sprinklers that look like shiny backbones left over from some science fiction war. They come alive once or twice a week, spitting water and chemicals as they roll slowly in great circles. They save work, allowing sons and daughters who once toiled with irrigation pipes the time to get into trouble. <br><br>I certainly am not blaming the sprinklers for what my best friend, Tom, and I did. <br><br>For us, David City was about fifteen hundred miles from anywhere fast enough and slammed up enough to be worthwhile, meaning L.A. or New York. The very tranquility of the town irritated us. We felt landlocked and depressed. So we lived from weekend to weekend, party to party, inventing half-assed rowdiness after the football games and speeding off to drinking parties out under the stars with girls. <br><br>That would pass for happiness for a while. Tom and I were both sports stars in high school. I had worked for that brief stardom. Back before I was old enough to start driving, I would dribble a basketball with my weak hand all the way to school each day, and all the way home each evening. At home, I practiced endlessly under the old hoop in our driveway, even when it was dark and so cold that the ball was hard as a rock and full of bounce. The purpose of life was tracked on scoreboards in those years.<br><br>I had always been determined to have an interesting life. Not a superstar life necessarily. But, you know, at least something--not the wasted life of a wage slave shoveling cow manure--my last real job before the banks.<br><br>Now I was on my way to spending a decade or more in federal prison, which wasn't exactly like heading off to summer camp. It would be heavy weather no matter how you looked at it. And if I didn't make it, well, I had always figured I would die young anyway.<br><br>The plane banked sharply and I saw the suburban fringe of Oklahoma City close below--clean little cars on clean little streets in shopping center parking lots, and the green and brown athletic fields of perfect high schools. <br><br>Regular life can seem small and too well ordered, but seeing it, I longed for all that suddenly, to be small and well ordered and free. All those people down there were doing whatever they wanted today--or at least choosing who would tell them what to do.<br><br>The airline flying us through this storm was JPATS. Trust me when I say you don't want frequent-flyer miles on this one. The initials stand for the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System. It is operated by the U.S. Marshal's Service, and it moves a few hundred thousand federal prisoners around the country each year. Inmates call it Con Air. The planes are similar to commercial jets, though a bit worn inside from years of handcuffs, belly chains, ankle shackles, and sociopaths. The seat belt sign always stays on, though mine had a little broken blink to it. The bathrooms are for the marshals. The conversations with seatmates differ from other airlines--they're mostly about robberies, drug deals gone bad, snitches, and news about who is now in which prison. <br><br>We banked hard again, and I took another look at the town below, now a worried brown. The hardworking people down there were no doubt looking up fearfully, but not at us--we were the lesser danger that day.<br><br>You have probably looked up and seen, without knowing, these prisoner planes flying over like white and mostly unmarked Pandora seeds blowing in the wind.<br><br>The marshals, mostly in their thirties, were more professional than the guards back in the county jails. The county guards looked like people who had fallen into those jobs, not by choice, and while they had grown a bit mean, you could at least picture having a drink with them someday. Not these federal marshals. They resembled mercenaries who had come back to the States after working in tough places, doing tough things. I was sure that if they suddenly received an order to march us out the back door without parachutes, they would not hesitate to do so.<br><br>Shortly before landing, to my surprise, they handed out apples, bone-dry crackers, and tiny boxes of juice. "Eat up fast, we're almost there," they repeated as they tossed the food from the aisle to a chained wave of big tan hands that shot up like rattling tambourines.<br><br>My seatmate, a black kid a few years younger than I was, watched as I struggled to place the drinking straw into the juice box and into my mouth.<br><br>"Why you got special handcuffs?" he asked. He seemed too young to be going to a federal prison. <br><br>"Bad luck," I answered. "They think I'm a flight risk."<br><br>He looked confused. "Like this flight?" <br><br>"No, like flight in general, as in run away."<br><br>He still didn't get it.<br><br>"It's just some bull." He accepted that with a nod. I guess his ears were plugged, or maybe he was just slow or had an undiagnosed hearing problem. Maybe something like that had screwed him up in school, and here he was. When you come from poverty and a bad neighborhood, you're always walking the tightrope, and any wrong move or bad luck can knock you into a free fall. This kid should have been flying to meet his iron-willed grandmother instead of meeting armed guards and years of steel doors. But in my ten months in county jails I had learned to toughen my feelings about the many young lives you see wasted by bad drugs and bad drug laws. Most of them seemed so beaten down. The smarter and nicer ones--those qualities usually go together--really stood out. Some would even return a smile.<br><br>My special handcuffs had a rigid plastic piece between them that kept my hands stiffly apart like a stockade. Called a black box, inmate lore says it was designed by a former convict. The rigid piece connects to a belly chain. My leg shackles ensured that I could take only baby steps, but we all had those. <br><br>I had been flagged as a flight risk because back in the St. Louis county jail where I had been warehoused for two weeks an albino meth addict with two teeth had gotten angry at me and Craig, one of my codefendants, for changing the channel on a television. He told the guards we were planning to escape, and they believed him. We were all on the eighth floor of a high-security jail, a place where the elevators didn't move unless you had a key and a security badge. Only Houdini would have tried it from up there. But whenever I was transported after that I received the special restraints otherwise reserved for murderers and terrorists. At least they made me look dangerous; I would take anything that might help protect me.<br><br>My travels that morning had begun with a St. Louis guard pushing my face into a wall and calling me whiteboy, emphasizing the boy part. He was yelling in my ear that he would take care of me if I tried to escape, as if my even thinking about it was akin to challenging his manhood. <br><br>He had me by the hair and could have cracked my skull like a coconut against the bricks. Even so, I mouthed off. I said he must be incredibly stupid to believe a meth-head and think I was trying to escape, and that I would announce it to the world. That basically did it. I could feel it coming. But another guard intervened and held the guard's arm. They compromised on a kidney punch that sent me to my knees.<br><br>A dozen of us were taken by bus to an airport on the other side of the river from St. Louis and there we were met by fifty or so men with rifles and shotguns. They thanked us for our visit and showed us the way to the plane. We flew to Terre Haute to pick up more prisoners, then Detroit, Chicago, then Rochester, Minnesota, then somewhere in South Dakota, then finally to the back of the Oklahoma City airport, where there is a large holding facility for federal prisoners. It was like a garbage run: we were coming into the Oklahoma City transfer station, on our way to a landfill somewhere. <br><br>Assuming we didn't crash, of course. I knew there was a tornado or two in the storm. On final approach, my seatmate began mumbling. <br><br>"I never done this before," he finally blurted out. <br><br>"You mean going to prison or flying?"<br><br>"Both I guess. They always jump around like this?"<br><br>"It's not unusual." I lied. <br><br>There was in fact a tornado coming, and more than one. The Oklahoma tornadoes that day were among the most powerful ever recorded. The main one was a hair under a category six--almost unheard of. In those four days of tornadoes, in the first week of May 1999, sixty-six twisters would kill forty-eight people in and around Oklahoma City. <br><br>We touched down and tipped slightly to the right as the pilot fought to keep us on the runway. He throttled the engines louder and then back, and we settled in. As we taxied, marshals rushed through the cabin to unfasten our seatbelts. "Get ready to move fast when we give the word," they yelled a dozen times. "We're racing a twister, so move when we say move." <br><br>Everyone contorted to look out the windows. I could see a black funnel cloud approaching, maybe two miles from the airport. All the guys on my side of the plane could see it. There were a lot of comments, all beginning with the word "holy."<br><br>The plane rolled past the civilian terminal to the federal facility. Extending from that large fortress were two Jetway ramps like a mother's impatient arms. The pilot was making fast turns and hitting the brakes at odd times. He stopped at the gate with a sudden deep dip like a teenager in driver's ed, sending the marshals into an aisle dance that drew some laughs.<br><br>"Move it, boys, up, up, up!" the marshals shouted. We clanked our way through the aisle and shuffled as fast as we could into the tin corridor outside.<br><br>"Faster, men, go, go, go!" The federal guards in the Jetway seemed anxious for their own survival as they shoved and shouted us along. There were about seventy-five of us, each with ankle chains, belly chains, and wrist shackles, all running in baby step rhythm now: chink chink chink--go go go! Running in ankle chains is like running with skinny jeans around your ankles.<br><br>We fast-stepped it as the apocalypse roared louder overhead. Near the front of the line a man tripped, and down went fifteen behind him. They were pulled to their feet by guards and each other, and the line again started jerking ahead, with the men in the back yelling to hurry up and the men in the middle, including me, trying not to trip. My basketball years helped me move better than most. The metal corridor was rocking. The kid in front of me, my seatmate, glanced back for moral support. I gave him a smile like this is always the way we do it. <br><br>I was actually okay with all of it. I was hoping the funnel cloud would take us away to Kansas or home to Nebraska or wherever it had in mind--right into the next life would have been fine. Had the whole chain gang swirled up into the cloud, most of the dots would have been black; I would have been one of the few white charms in the necklace. I was twenty-three.</p><h2>Landscapes in Relief: Carving Techniques and Patterns</h2><p>Country landscape scenes featuring barns, churches, rustic mills, and mountain valleys are especially attractive when executed in the relief style of woodcarving.

Her work, which has garnered an O. Henry Prize and a Pushcart Prize, is published widely in literary journals. Schutt lives and teaches in New York City.A debut collection made up of 17 stories (or, in some cases, slivers of story) told in voices flattened by despair. The narrators here are mostly nameless, and the uneasy territory of their subject matter cannot readily be labeled. In the opening piece, ``You Drive,'' a grown daughter and her father cross the boundaries of any usual parent-child relationship as they sit in a car, sharing secrets, kissing and memorizing the smell and texture of one another's skin. In ``What Have You Been Doing?,'' it's a mother and son who kiss: ``She was out of practice and he wanted practice. . . . In the middle of rooms she obliged, in her bedroom, his bedroom, a kissing done standing, her hands on his shoulders, his not quite on her waist, heads tilted, mouths open.'' Another mother, in ``Teachers,'' tells her daughter details about her lover while the girl yearns to get away, begging to be allowed just to go off to school. The spareness of Schutt's prose, in combination with her elliptical storylines, can make certain pieces (notably ``Giovanni and Giovanna'' and ``His Chorus'') difficult to decipher at all. But when she works with more accessible themes, the results are powerful, as in ``Daywork,'' where two adult daughters guiltily clean out the attic of their mother's house as she lies dying in the hospital, and ``To Have and To Hold,'' as a spurned wife acts upon her anger and grief in her tiny and terrifyingly tidy kitchen. Schutt is good at small, sharp moments, and she chooses words with the care of a poet. But effective as some of these tales are, others feel fragmentary, incomplete. Taken all together, they're finally overwhelming in the uniform grimness of their point of view. Razor-sharp writing in stories sliced a little too thin--and admittedly close to the bone. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It closed again, and Isabella Beauchamps shivered with delighted anticipation.<br><br>"Come on!" she urged her twin stepsisters, as they hung back a little. "It sounds like the dancing has just started!"<br><br>"I still don't think&#x2014;" said Amber.<br><br>"It's so...d�class�&#x2014;" said Pearl.<br><br>"Of course it is," Bella replied, laughing. "That's why it's going to be fun! For once, you're going to come to a dance and enjoy yourselves!" She seized each of them by the hand, and tugged them to the door of the Wool Guildhall.<br><br>"But what if someone&#x2014;" said Amber.<br><br>"Recognizes us?" finished Pearl.<br><br>"You're wearing your masks, for one thing," Bella replied, logically. "And for another, <em>those are last year's gowns.</em> Would anyone believe you'd wear last year's gowns?"<br><br>"No!" they replied in chorus, and then giggled behind their free hands. "They'll probably think I'm Jeanette," said Amber. "And Pearl is Marguerite."<br><br>"Very likely. Now come on!" Providentially, someone opened the door once more, and Bella pulled them through it before they could object again.<br><br>Last year's fashions had included a vogue for "shepherdess gowns," although these looked like no shepherdess that Bella was familiar with. She had successfully managed to get them to keep the gowns rather than giving them away as they usually did when the fashions changed, arguing that they would make good fancy-dress costumes.<br><br>Both gowns had short skirts that showed the girls' feet in embroidered dancing slippers, trim little ankles in silk stockings and a hint of ruffled pantaloons. There were only three ruffled petticoats and no crinolines. The undergowns were of silk, embroidered with sprigs of flowers&#x2014;though only in the front, where it showed. The draped overgowns were of silk-satin, trimmed on the hems with silk roses and three layers of ruffled lace. The bodices were tight-fitting, but not so tight that they wouldn't be able to breathe&#x2014;unlike several of the girls' more fashionable outfits&#x2014;and were made of the same satin, lace and silk roses as the skirt of the overgown. Pearl's was pink, Amber's was lilac. When she had first seen the gowns, Bella had thought privately that they looked less like shepherdesses and more like cakes with girls stuck in the middle. But then the vogue for all things bucolic had brought a set of porcelain shepherd and shepherdess figurines into the house, and she realized that <em>this</em> was how people who had never seen a living sheep thought their minders looked&#x2014;and the fashion copied it.<br><br>Once inside she dropped their hands and paused, waiting for the impact of the room to fade. At the far end of the Hall was a raised platform, and the entire platform at the moment was covered in musicians. Not content with hiring just a few, the Guild had hired every decent musician for miles around, and even paid them to rehearse together. There were fiddlers, flute players, a drummer, three harpists, four lutenists, a trumpeter and players of instruments Bella couldn't even name.<br><br>Just now they were playing for a Running Set dance&#x2014;and both of Bella's sisters made identical little Os with their mouths and clasped their hands together with delight. They'd never seen anything like this, of course. It wasn't the sort of dance that their dancing master would teach or approve of.<br><br>It was at times like these that Bella really adored her silly little stepsisters. They might be frivolous, they might think far too much about fashion and far too little about virtually everything else, but they had good hearts. Where girls who put on airs would look at this gathering and turn up their noses and sniff with disdain, they looked at people having fun, thought it wonderful and wanted to join.<br><br>The musicians were sawing and plucking and blowing for all they were worth, and keeping up an exhausting pace. Those who weren't dancing were clapping and stamping in time. And as Pearl and Amber were about to discover, anyone could join the dance at any time. Bella grinned as she spotted three stalwart lads separating themselves from the crowd on the sidelines and heading straight for them.<br><br>The Wool Guild had far more male members than female, and even with the addition of daughters and other relatives, unattached women were thin on the ground at a gathering like this one. Add as these three unattached women were young, shapely and what showed under their masks was comely enough, she was not at all surprised to see three more young fellows detach from another part of the crowd and head for them, too.<br><br>Bella never did see how they sorted themselves out. She had already chosen her partner from the six as they approached, and maneuvered herself so that he was the first to get to her. He was quick; he grinned as he saw her coyly reaching for him and he seized her hand, swinging her into the Set without a single word. She had no fear that her sisters would get into trouble, not here. The matrons of the Guild stood as chaperones to every young woman who entered the Hall tonight, fierce dragons ensuring not only the safety of the girls, but that their boys were not ensnared by a young woman who was "no better than she should be." This allowed the young to enjoy themselves to the hilt in freedom&#x2014;limited, but still freedom&#x2014;and let them revel in the anonymity of their masks.<br><br>Bella loved to dance. Especially country dances. The fancy nonsense taught by their dancing master was too mannered and contrived to be fun. You had to think too much about the steps, and the music was as mannered as the dances. The Running Set left her just warmed up, and when another partner presented himself for a Chardash, she was more than ready to step out. She did keep a bit of an eye on her seventeen-year-old stepsisters, but they were having the same innocent fun that she was. They never had the same partner twice, they never spent too long in the company of any one young man and when they finally got winded&#x2014;much sooner than Bella did, but then they didn't get nearly the exercise that she did&#x2014;they repaired to a bench big enough for only two, where they were surrounded by young men eager to bring them cups of punch and flirt harmlessly with them. Pearl's careful arrangement of curls was beginning to come down, but for once, she was indifferent to the disintegration of her perfection. In fact, the next time Bella came around the floor, she saw that Pearl had pulled out her hairpins and taken a ribbon to make a simple headband with a flower tucked into it. Privately, Bella thought the effect was much more flattering than the overdone hairstyle that she had been sporting.<br><br>The musicians signaled that they were taking a rest by ending the dance with a special flourish. Without being asked, Bella's partner escorted her to her stepsisters. There wasn't room for her on their bench, but she didn't mind; she stood behind them and accepted a cup of punch from yet another young man.<br><br>"I don't have to ask if you're having fun," she said, pulling a fan off her belt and vigorously cooling herself with it.<br><br>"I don't know when I have ever had such a good time!" Pearl whispered, as Amber giggled and sipped punch demurely. "No one has this much fun at the parties we get invited to."<br><br>The twins had caught their breath by this point, and allowed new partners to carry them off into the dance. For a moment Bella found herself without anyone to chaperone and without a partner&#x2014;<br><br>"Alone and defenseless. Just the way I like them," purred a voice in her ear.<br><br>Reflexively she stomped her neat little heel onto a set of booted toes, thrust an elbow behind her and nimbly leapt over the bench the twins had been sitting on. Since the current dance was a very lively Dargason, this went entirely unnoticed.<br><br>There was a muffled yelp and an equally muffled curse as reactions to her assault, but when she turned, whoever had accosted her was gone already.<br><br>She knew who it was, however. There was no mistaking that voice. Duke Sebastian's Gamekeeper&#x2014;who was rather too superior to allow anyone to call him a Gamekeeper to his face, insisting on the loftier title of <em>Woodsman.</em> He was, without a doubt, taking advantage of the fact that this was a masked ball to try his luck and his charms on girls who were here <em>without</em> Guardian Mamas. Well, too bad for him, the dog; he'd found a bitch who would bite back. <em>Serves him right,</em> she thought, seething a little. She didn't seethe long, though; a moment later the musicians struck up "Jenny Pluck Pears" and a partner materialized out of the crowd, and she was back to doing what she loved best.<br><br>Much earlier than she would have liked, but about the time it was prudent to take leave, she and the twins met at the bench again in a similar state of happy, panting, overheated exhaustion. "I really do not think," Amber puffed out, "that another round of punch is going to restore me one little bit."<br><br>"Me, either," Pearl panted, though she looked wistful.<br><br>Bella nodded. "All right, then, they've just brought a fresh bowl out. Let's slip away while there's a mob for punch."<br><br>About this time of night people started slipping something a bit stronger than wine into the punch, too. Not that, given the enormous bowl that was kept filled, one bottle of brandy was going to have much effect&#x2014;but it was better to leave while the only unpleasant spot on the festivities was that wretched Gamekeeper, Eric.<br><br>Once out in the night air, they were glad of their cloaks. Things were very frosty. "I think it will snow again soon," Bella remarked, as the three of them hurried through the silent streets to Henri Beauchamps's handsome house. "If you don't mind people knowing it's us, we can go skating on the pond by moonlight as soon as the ice is hard enough. There's usually a bonfire and chestnut sellers and mulled cider and music."<br><br>At nearly four years older than her stepsisters, Bella had been sneaking off to these dances long enough to know exactly which ones were going to be great fun, as this one had been, and which were ones that it was prudent to stay away from.<br><br>Bella unlocked the private door into the garden and gave each of the girls a little basket she had waiting on a shelf above where most people would look. "We're home!" she called up the staircase. "The girls found some nice things."<br><br>As she expected, it was Genevieve's maid that appeared, not Genevieve herself. "Mistress would like to see you when you have all changed into something more comfortable," she said, with the little sniff that told she meant <em>cleaner.</em><br><br>"Of course, we brought her a few things, as well. We'll be there in merest moments," Bella said breezily, ignoring the snub. She didn't at all mind; it meant that Genevieve was not going to be asking why the girls were in their shepherdess frocks when the gowns were no longer the mode and were rather unsuitable for scrambling about in their father's warehouse.<br><br>Henri Beauchamps was a merchant trader, as his father had been before him, and his father before that, coming up from a mere peddler with a single donkey; at the moment, he had a thriving business in furs, although at one time or another he had dealt in practically anything that wasn't living and couldn't be eaten. Bella had always had the run of the warehouse and the freedom to take anything she pleased, but when she had asked the twins if they wanted to go to the dance, she had hit upon the notion of saying they were going to the warehouse with her.<br><br>Now, the reason Bella went combing through the old stores was because she had an uncanny knack for finding forgotten treasures there. Many had been the time when Genevieve, Amber or Pearl would look at some bit of lace, panel of delicate embroidery or other little addition to her gowns and ask where she had got it. If she answered "the warehouse," there would be much sighing, for this meant it was not likely there was any more of it, nor would be ever again.<br><br>Genevieve was consequently quite happy to allow her girls to go rummaging through the building&#x2014;which was not at all dusty and dirty, though you could never persuade her of that. Thus, a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the girls would be out after supper. Bella had, in fact, made the selections in the three baskets yesterday.<br><br>They all hurried up to their rooms. The twins' maid was one of Henri's household, and was completely loyal to Bella; no fear there that the twins would be tattled on. And Bella herself did without a maid; she had elected to do so as soon as she was old enough to dress herself, and saw no reason to change unless the gown she had to get into was more complicated than the simple things she usually wore. When she was comfortable in nightgown, dressing gown and heavy plush robe with matching blue slippers, she picked up her basket and went to her stepmother's room.<br><br>Genevieve was sitting up in bed, like an expensive porcelain bed-doll on display, surrounded by the boxes and jars and cabinets full of the pills she took for her many&#x2014;mostly imagined&#x2014;ailments. Genevieve fancied herself an invalid. She kept three doctors busy&#x2014;<br><br>Well, she <em>would</em> have kept them busy if they had actually been treating her. Instead they were pretending to treat her, honest gentlemen that they were, giving her harmless concoctions made of flowers, simple herbs that could do no harm and even bits of baked cookie dough. They charged her father almost nothing, and yet, because they knew Genevieve so very well, they were alert to anything that <em>might</em> be an illness, serious or otherwise. He in his turn kept these old friends well supplied with the finest wines and brandies that he came across in his trading ventures, so it was a good arrangement all around.<br><br>"It's Genevieve's hobby," he had once told Bella, when she made some scornful remark about it. "It's harmless enough since I am not actually paying my friends anything, and she is not being dosed with things that really <em>would</em> make her ill."<br><br>Privately, she wished they would. It might teach Genevieve a lesson to find herself purging and cramping.<br><br></p><h2>The Strangers in the House (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Dirty, drunk, unloved, and unloving, Hector Loursat has been a bitter recluse for eighteen long years&#x2014;ever since his wife abandoned him and their newborn child to run off with another man. Once a successful lawyer, Loursat now guzzles burgundy and buries himself in books, taking little notice of his teenage daughter or the odd things going on in his vast and ever-more-dilapidated mansion.

What he stumbles on is a murder.<br><br>Soon Loursat discovers that his daughter and her friends have been leading a dangerous secret life. He finds himself strangely drawn to this group of young people, and when one of them is accused of the murder, he astonishes the world by taking up the young man&#x2019;s defense.<br><br>In <i>The Strangers in the House</i>, Georges Simenon, master chronicler of the dark side of the human heart, gives us a detective story that is also a tale of an improbable redemption.</p><p><b>Georges Simenon</b> (1903&#x2014;1989) emerged as a writer in the 1930s, gaining renown for his detective stories featuring Inspector Maigret. He is no less famous for his psychological novels. New York Review Books has published revised translations of Simenon's most acclaimed <i>romans durs, </i>including <i>Dirty Snow</i>, <i>Three Bedrooms in Manhattan, The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, Monsieur Monde Vanishes,</i> <i>Tropic Moon, </i>and most recently, <i>Red Lights. </i><br><br><b>P.D. James</b> is the author of eighteen books. She served in the forensics and criminal justice departments of Great Britain&#x2019;s Home Office, and she has been a magistrate and a governor of the BBC. In 2000 she published her autobiography, <i>Time to Be in Earnest.</i>"The greatest literary discovery I have made in recent time is Georges Simenon--his 'hard' novels, such as <i>Dirty Snow</i> and <i>The Strangers in the House</i>. So impressed was I by these books that I was determined to write one. The result is <i>Christine Falls</i>." --Benjamin Black (John Banville), <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Most of Simenon's novels are short, 200 pages or less, short enough to be read in one or two sittings. His style is spare but unusually potent. If you want to learn how to use adjectives - which is to say, with economy and precision - read Simenon. His skill at creating a sense of place is uncanny. When you finish <i>The Strangers in the House,</i> the memory of the dark and rainy streets of Moulins, the town where the story is set, stays with you palpably." &#x2014;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>"This is not a Maigret but one of the French master's romans durs and is quite simply a masterpiece." --John Banville<br><br>&#x201c;Attention should be paid to the New York Review of Books' continuing reissues of Georges Simenon. Simenon was legendary both for his literary skill&#x2013;four or five books every year for 40 years&#x2013;and his sexual capacity, at least to hear him tell it. What we can speak of with some certainty are the novels, which are tough, rigorously unsentimental and full of rage, duplicity and, occasionally, justice. Simenon's tone and dispassionate examination of humanity was echoed by Patricia Highsmith, who dispensed with the justice. So far, the Review has published <i>Tropic Moon, The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, Red Lights, Dirty Snow </i>and <i>Three Bedrooms in Manhattan</i>; <i>The Strangers in the House</i> comes out in November.

They are also more philosophically profound than any of the fiction of Camus or Sartre, and far less self-conscious. This is existentialism with a backbone of tempered steel.&#x201d;&#x2013;John Banville, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"This is what attracts and holds me in him. He writes for `the vast public,' to be sure, but delicate and refined readers find something for them too as soon as they begin to take him seriously. He makes one reflect; and this is close to being the height of art; how superior he is in this to those heavy novelists who do not spare us a single commentary! Simenon sets forth a particular fact, perhaps of general interest; but he is careful not to generalize; that is up to the reader."&#x2013;Andr� Gide<br><br>&#x201c;[Simenon] digs right inside his protagonists heads, in ways so specific that his characters have a forceful and very convincing individuality.

In the hushed twilight, amid the toiling of bells, a candle was lit for each victim, and the flames were used to light smaller candles held by townspeople attending the service. </p><p>The hijackers had failed in their mission, Ridge said. They had not destroyed our spirit. They had rekindled it. By fighting back against the terrorists, the passengers and crew had undoubtedly saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. "They sacrificed themselves for others -- the ultimate sacrifice. What appears to be a charred, smolerdering hole in the ground," said the governor, "is truly and really a monument to heroism." </p><p>Of the four horrific hijackings on September 11, Flight 93, which crashed into a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, resonates as one of epic resistance. A number of passengers phoned relatives and others on the ground to tell them of the hijacking and what they planned to do about it. Their battle to take back the plane brought consolation to countless confused and grief-stricken Americans. At a time when the United States appeared defenseless against an unfamiliar foe, the gallant passengers and crew of Flight 93 provided for many Americans a measure of victory in the midst of unthinkable defeat. Together, they seemingly accomplished what all the security guards and soldiers, military pilots and government officials, could not -- they thwarted the terrorists, sacrificing their own lives so that others might live. </p><p>The culmination of hundreds of interviews and months of investigation, <em>Among the Heroes</em> is the definitive story of the courageous men and women aboard Flight 93, and of the day that forever changed the way Americans view the world and themselves.</p></p><p><p>Jer� Longman is a sports reporter for the <em>New York Times</em> whose books include the national bestseller <em>Among the Heroes: United Flight 93 and the Passengers and Crew Who Fought Back</em> and <em>The Hurricanes: One High School Team's Homecoming After Katrina</em>, chosen by <em>Slate</em> magazine as one of the Best Books of 2008.</p>The 9/11 flight that crashed in Pennsylvania, presumably on its way to devastate either the White House or the Capitol, is the subject of a riveting account by Longman, a reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>. In his words, the passengers of United Flight 93 "thwarted" the terrorists; it is clear to him that the "passengers and crew acted with heroic defiance." Longman spoke with all the affected families except one. His account of the "brave uprising [that] will surely be remembered as a defining moment in American history" gives us an incredibly detailed and personal tale of that horrific episode, during which ordinary citizens proved their mettle and altered their fate. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I sometimes fear that I am teaching her too well, and the Guild will lose a promising jester to the world of burglary.</p><p>My point about the locks is that even though I don&#x2019;t trust them, and even though I will follow the ritual locking of our door and barring of the shutters on the lower floor of our home by then rigging an elaborate system of trip lines that will ring bells and cause clanging pans to tumble to the ground, with the added surprise of a bucket of water poised to topple onto any would-be invader coming through the front door despite its lockedness (a proud innovation of mine that Claudia, my wife, would prefer staying unimplemented, given the increasing mobility of Portia, our fifteen-month-old daughter), nevertheless I am much less likely to spring into action&#x2014;fully alert, dagger in hand, poised and ready to throw&#x2014;now that we live in a house in the city with locked doors as opposed to sleeping unprotected outside in, say, a forest clearing. Then again, I&#x2019;ve never had good luck with forest clearings.</p><p>Of course, it could also be because I am getting older.</p><p>So, when the banging on our front door commenced while we were all sound asleep on the second floor, the first to wake was Portia, who, finding herself in the dark with what was no doubt some kind of monster trying to devour her, did the sensible thing and screamed at the tops of her lungs. This in turn woke Helga, with whom she now shared a room to the dismay of both. The twelve-year-old scooped up the toddler in an unsuccessful attempt to comfort her, then gave up and marched into our bedroom and unceremoniously dumped her into our bed. Portia scooted onto her mother in an effort to restore recently revoked nursing privileges. Claudia yelped and dislodged her, which set off a new round of screaming for different reasons. This no doubt would have roused me, had not the repeated kicking of my beloved in the general vicinity of my rib cage already done the trick.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s someone banging on the front door,&#x201d; said Helga.</p><p>&#x201c;Then go answer it,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dark.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That explains why I can&#x2019;t see anything,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m relieved. I thought that I had gone blind, and the way I was drinking last night, that would have been no surprise. Go answer the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The rule is that I don&#x2019;t answer the door when it&#x2019;s dark,&#x201d; said Helga. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s dark.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who made that rule?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You did,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m changing it. Go answer the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t change rules at night,&#x201d; said Helga. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s another rule.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who made that rule?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; said Claudia. &#x201c;Now, get downstairs and answer the damn door before we wake the entire neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back to sleep,&#x201d; announced Helga, leaving us to our doom.</p><p>&#x201c;New rules in the morning,&#x201d; I called after her as I groped around for my boots. &#x201c;Lots of new rules. And there will be a test afterwards.&#x201d;</p><p>I staggered downstairs to the lower room and promptly managed to stumble over most of the trip lines. By the time I got to the front door, my ears were ringing, I had a pounding headache, and I was drenched with a bucket&#x2019;s worth of water.</p><p>&#x201c;This had better be worth money up front,&#x201d; I growled as I unlocked the door and flung it open.</p><p>Sancho, one of the count&#x2019;s guard, was standing there, a&nbsp;torch in his hand. He looked at me quizzically. &#x201c;Hallo, Pierre,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What was all that ruckus? Are you rehearsing a new routine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Sancho, that is exactly what I was doing,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all wet,&#x201d; he pointed out helpfully.</p><p>&#x201c;I know this,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Was there anything else you wished to tell me? If not, I am going back to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, now that you mention it, there was,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The count wants to see you, Nowish, or thereabouts. Sooner, if possible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in one of his fouler moods, and wants cheering up by his fool,&#x201d; said Sancho. &#x201c;Can you be funny at this hour?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one can be funny at this hour,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I suggest that you put the lie to that,&#x201d; said Sancho. &#x201c;See if you&#x2019;ve got any dry motley, and come along.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I grumbled. &#x201c;Care to come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am thinking not,&#x201d; he said, peering cautiously into the dark interior at the tangle of ropes now littering the floor. &#x201c;I will stay out here in the Godforsaken city night, where it is safe.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought I had accounted for all my trip lines on my first pass through the room, but one I had previously missed caught me just before the stairs, sending me headlong into the wall. Fortunately, I already had a headache, so it only made it worse.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; asked Claudia sleepily as I came into the room in search of my good motley.</p><p>&#x201c;Sancho,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The count wants me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; she mumbled as Portia nestled contentedly against her bosom.</p><p>Dammit, that was my spot.</p><p>I changed hurriedly, then leaned over and kissed my daughter and my wife.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wet,&#x201d; Claudia murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve been told,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;However, a dry fool...&#x201d;</p><p>A snore floated up from the bed. I didn&#x2019;t know if it was real, or her way of stopping me before I completed a joke she had heard too many times before. Either way, it was my cue to leave. I slung my lute and my gearbag over my shoulder and went back downstairs.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the family?&#x201d; asked Sancho as I locked the door behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, thank you, and asleep, thank you again,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;When are you going to get one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When the dice roll more favorably for me,&#x201d; he sighed. &#x201c;Just when I think I&#x2019;ve made my nest egg, along comes the snake with its beady little eyes to suck it dry. Aren&#x2019;t you going to put on your makeup?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When my face is dry,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a glass to do it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can get your armor on in the dark, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In less time than it takes to sing a psalm,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Long as I&#x2019;m sober, and unencumbered by the soft white arms of a willing maid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was not the arms of my willing maid, but her feet that drove me out of bed,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;They smell that bad, do they?&#x201d; he said sympathetically.</p><p>I reached over and rapped him gently on his iron cap.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>&#x201c;Ow,&#x201d; he said finally.</p><p>&#x201c;Why is the count in such a foul mood this early?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;This late, rather,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Been up all night, far as I can tell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t been to bed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He has been to bed, but he has not slept well,&#x201d; I surmised. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been doing that more and more lately, hasn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not for me to say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course it is, good Sancho. If I go into his chambers unprepared, then chances are that I will not lighten his mood, and we will all suffer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve convinced me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Well, not that I am one to gossip, but as one who stands outside his door, ever alert as one is required to be, one occasionally hears things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what did one hear tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming up along fifty years, he has a new hot-blooded wife of eighteen, and although numbers have never been my strength, I would say that they do not favor him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The eyes of the snake have struck again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A man sorely needs a laugh at a time like this,&#x201d; said Sancho. &#x201c;As long as he is the one laughing, not being laughed at by his new hot-blooded wife of eighteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is all I need to know, friend Sancho,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And I thank you for it.&#x201d;</p><p>Usually when I see a city at this time of morning, I am coming home from an unusually lengthy and debauched party, my safe-passage pass clutched openly in my hand for immediate presentation to the nightwatch, my senses somewhat dulled by wine and exhaustion yet on the alert for any danger lurking in the alleys. Now, on the other hand, I was on my way to work with a friendly and heavily armed companion, which allowed me to take in the sleeping city of Toulouse with only the distant torchlight of the watch-towers and the thin sliver of moon to illuminate it. No colors now in the Pink City, just silhouettes and shadows, the rats and the wraiths flitting about while the unperturbed populace dreamed peacefully in their beds, their own locked doors protecting them.

It foresees the West succumbing to a form of international socialism that crushes individuality. The forces of secular materialism, relativism and state control are everywhere triumphant. Protestantism is no more, and Catholicism which had seen a period of renewal in the first half of the twentieth century has been devastated by the development of new psychologies and the exodus of intellectuals in the wake of an Ecumenical Council. Euthanasia has become an instrument of the state, Esperanto the universal second language. Nevertheless, although organised religion has largely collapsed in the face of institutional secularism, a vague, humanistic religiosity militantly hostile to the exclusive and supernatural claims of the Church is present everywhere. Finally, the East, which has amalgamated into a single, pantheistic bloc, poses a military threat. With the world adrift from all spiritual moorings and seemingly doomed to enter into a civil war between East and West a sinister figure appears from nowhere to achieve world domination.

All stories, Aristotle said, have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but most ends are relative, the terminus of this chain of acts or that. But what of the end that terminates all human action as we know it, the end of time itself, the Second Coming? Since this novel appeared in 1906, many others have been devoted to nuclear disaster, destructive comets, and other hair-raising possibilities. What sets Benson&#x2019;s story apart and makes it as readable today as when it was written is the Catholic and biblical context that provides the ultimate meaning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#x2013;1914) was the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his conversion to Catholicism caused a stir. He became a great apologist for the faith, in spiritual works as well as in works of the imagination. Lord of the World is first of all a tremendous &#x201c;read,&#x201d; but it is also spiritual food for thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late Ralph McInerny contributed a fine preface to the work, and recently Fr. C. John McCloskey III, a specialist on the work of Robert Hugh Benson, added a fascinating introduction.<br>&nbsp;</p>LORD OF THE WORLD is a bitingly satiric science fiction novel of a secularized world state. As Rosa Mulholland, Lady Gilbert, declared, "It is a brilliant, beautiful, and terrible book," a judgment in which the public has fully concurred for nearly a century. LORD OF THE WORLD is the only one of Benson&#x2019;s novels to remain continually in print from its first publication in 1907 down to the present day. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen declared, "The three great apocalyptic pieces of literature dealing with the advent of the satanic are Father Hugh Benson&#x2019;s LORD OF THE WORLD, Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV, and Soloviev&#x2019;s THREE CONVERSATIONS ON WAR."</p><h2>The Temari Book: Techniques &amp; Patterns for Making Japanese Thread Balls</h2><p>Collects instructions for making and designing the traditional Japanese New Year&#39;s decoration</p><p>x<br></p><h2>The Book of Durrow: A Medieval Masterpiece at Trinity College Dublin</h2><p>Written by monks in Early Christian Ireland, the Book of Durrow is the earliest surviving fully-decorated insular Gospel book.

The story starts in earnest with the year after the war, when his quest to find himself takes him to Mexico, where he punches out his young man&#x2019;s recollections on an old portable typewriter, beginning a lifelong habit of looking inward, of observation and note-taking. We follow him to Martha Foley&#x2019;s famous short fiction class at Columbia University, and then to Europe, where he spends nearly three years in 1950s Spain, part of the expat communities of Mallorca, Madrid, and Tenerife, keeping the journals that form the basis of this memoir.<br><br>We meet dozens of fascinating people: the large and generous Park Benjamin, who put him up in Mexico City; the restless, self-involved expatriates of Mallorca; Pepe Mut and other Spanish friends Graves sails and fishes with, and who allow him to become acquainted with the real Spain; and many other artists and writers, both famous and unknown.<br><br>It is a time of serious work and serious play, but whether cheering at a bullfight, sipping a strong local wine at a Canary Island literary salon, or spearing crustaceans underwater, Graves never forgets his deep-seated literary ambition. &#x201c;I would like so God-damned much to write something worth writing,&#x201d; he says in an early journal entry. And we see him producing, despite many false starts, a stream of stories and articles and the beginning of a novel. <br><br>By the end of <i>Myself and Strangers</i>, Graves has returned to Texas, where he finds both his true voice and the world that has become the focus of much of his admired work. Here is a wonderfully revealing portrait of a young writer on his way&#x2014;of the strivings, struggles, and self-scrutiny that marked the beginning of an extraordinary literary career.</p><p>John Graves was born in Texas and educated at Rice and Columbia universities. He has published a number of books, chiefly nonfiction concerned with his home region. He currently lives with his wife on some four hundred acres of rough Texas hill country, which he described in <i>Hard Scrabble</i>.One<br>Origins<br>(1920-1945)<br><br>I was born and grew up rather unexceptionally in the prairie city of Fort Worth, Texas, my late childhood and youth coinciding with the years of the Great Depression. My family were "nice people" in the Southern phrase, Episcopalian and conservative, with quite a few of the implicit privileges pertaining to that classification, though my father's struggles to stay financially afloat in the 1930s kept us at times barely within the local Establishment's boundaries.<br><br>Lying on the eastern rim of the West Texas ranching country, the city had large stockyards and meat-packing plants, an annual Livestock Exposition with its rodeo, and many visitors who wore high-heeled boots and wide hats legitimately, because these were related to their daily work. But its underlying ethos was also quite Southern. Its mythic heroes were often Confederate soldiers, like my four great-uncles, from both sides of the family, of whom two had gotten themselves killed in battle and a third had lost a leg at Chickamauga. Many of the parents of my contemporaries in the town came from other regions, usually in the South-my own mother was born in South Carolina and my father grew up in coastal Texas with a merchant father, though his mother's people had all been ranchers.<br><br>Ranching and farming mattered far more in the Texas of those days than they do now. In Fort Worth they were a recent part of most of my friends' family backgrounds, and a number of us, after we were big enough to be of any use, spent our summers doing country work, usually for relatives and at the abysmal rural wages of Depression times. ("A dollar a day and keep" was standard, and workdays often lasted eleven or twelve hours.) My own experience of this sort was not very grand, but it meant a lot to me. One of my older cousins was married to a man who ran a stock farm of several hundred acres not far west of the city, a place that was mainly rangeland, utilized by his beef cattle, and partly creekbottom fields sowed annually to various grain crops.<br><br>There I drove an old tractor ahead of a plow, or a binder cutting ripe wheat or oats and tying them into bundles that it dropped into the stubble as it moved along. Afterward I and other workers would stack six or eight of those bundles at a time into shocks to await the arrival of an itinerant thresher, and would do other tasks that needed doing, the most pleasant of which for me-because it had the flavor of old romance-was riding out on horseback and helping to drive in feisty crossbred cattle for branding, dehorning, castration, doctoring, or shipping to market.<br><br>There were other fine things about that work. Sometimes I labored alongside talkative Mexican illegals on seasonal jobs like fence repair and firewood cutting, and absorbed from them the Spanish names of things and a stock of unseemly words and phrases. The boss himself, my cousin-in-law, though he was a rough, profane, powerful individual intolerant of weakness in others, was intelligent and had an inquiring mind. He knew much local history, for instance, going back to the Comanche wars of the region, and had a remarkable familiarity with the names and habits of the birds and wild mammals that were all around us there. Later-in part I guess because of him-I went more deeply into these subjects on my own.<br><br>And I retained an interest in the land and all that it meant. . . .<br><br>Papa had a well-regarded men's clothing store downtown, but his venerable partner, just before the Depression showed its fangs, had bought a large stock of costly merchandise on credit and had promptly died, leaving Papa with the debt during tough times, in an era when bankruptcy was still a major disgrace. A decent and generous-spirited man, he tried not to impose this situation on his family, but it was there.<br><br>Hence, for me, there was a slight element of outsiderness that might have helped to keep me from conforming to the pattern into which most of my Fort Worth crowd fitted comfortably, and might also have helped me to break loose later. There were other such semi-outsiders around, and we tended to know one another and to go our own ways after high school, though a few made the jump and became true Establishment types. People of that more standard ilk most often attended the University of Texas in Austin, joining one of three or four "in" fraternities there and getting to know ruling-class scions from all over the state, with whom they would wheel and deal for the rest of their lives. The friendships I had among them, of which there were enough, were based on having grown up in a neighborhood together and attending the same public schools, and on much hunting, fishing, and other country activity. A number of the less prosperous ones ultimately married money, and as a result made more money and became staid and conservative adults, as their parents had hoped all along they would do. I suppose my parents had hoped for much the same thing, though they never pushed me in that direction.<br><br>I was not a rebel loaded with social bitterness, but I did see early that those friends' pattern was not for me. For one thing, I was an inveterate reader and shared few of the ruling passions of their world, such as spectator sports, school spirit, and discussion of what local families had how much money. So when the time came, I attended the small scholarly college of Rice in Houston, soaked up literature and history and friendships, and have been grateful ever since for the experience and the institution.<br><br>By the time I finished my studies there we had a war on our hands and, along with several million other Americans, I went to it, another break with personal background. Patriotism was involved, of course, but I think mainly I just wanted to see the fighting. If you had grown up on tales of Rebel great-uncles and the Marines at Belleau Wood, you tended to feel that way.<br><br>At Quantico, Virginia, I endured candidates' class and was made a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, got imbued with esprit, went through artillery school, and then was sent to Camp Pendleton on the west coast, where the new Fourth Marine Division was being shaped up. This unit shipped out of San Diego in January of 1944, combat-loaded for the invasion of Kwajalein Atoll.<br><br>War is an overwhelming sort of subject and possibly has small pertinence to reminiscences concerned with a writing apprenticeship. But as a force it loomed behind my generation for the rest of our lives, and since my fighting career was pretty short, I might as well summarize it here.<br><br>Kwajalein was not a tough battle for most artillerists besides the forward observers landing with the infantry. Our guns were set up on islets within firing range of the main fortified islands, Roi and Namur, which were being pounded by naval gunfire and bombs from aircraft. I and my gun crewmen and our four 75-millimeter howitzers (toys in today's terms) spent the night on one such islet, got sniped at by two or three lingering Japanese who had to be hunted down in the palms and underbrush, and the next morning fired on Roi-Namur in support of the main infantry landing there, until friends and enemies in the beachhead, as reported by our observers on their radios, became so intertangled that we had to stop shooting. And for us that was Kwajalein, though the infantry, as usual, suffered its full quota of casualties.<br><br>Then came a sojourn at the new Fourth Division tent camp on a flank of Maui's Haleakala volcano, a pleasant time that didn't last long, for in June we went to Saipan in the Marianas. This was no atoll but a fourteen-mile strip of rough hills full of caves, cliffs, gun emplacements, bunkers, and self-confident hate-filled foemen who gave us hell on the beaches and kept it up as we pushed northward, for the whole time I was there, which turned out to be about two weeks. By then I was on the battalion staff as assistant operations officer, with a section of bright youngsters and duties concerned chiefly with surveying in new gun positions as the infantry advanced and we had to move forward time after time, in order to keep firing in their support. This involved instrument work in a sort of no-man's-land behind the front lines, where bypassed Japanese snipers, most of them fortunately poor shots, could make things interesting on occasion.<br><br>The beaches had been rough for just about everybody, but I lost only two men while engaged in that later surveying work, neither of them badly wounded, then received my own comeuppance at battalion headquarters one misty early morning, when thirty or forty disoriented Japanese, trying I think to get back to their main force, barged in on us over the top of a little hill and a brisk firefight ensued. They had the advantage of surprise, but we had a machine gun and more people and after a time the hill was quiet. I joined a group going up to check on things, but when we got among the bodies one turned out to be not a body but a live Jap playing dead, who-a friend told me later-rolled a grenade out in front of me which exploded.<br><br>The permanent damage turned out to be only the blinding of my left eye, but that was the end of my career as a combatant. After a few months in naval hospitals I finished out the war on limited duty in North Carolina, in charge of a demonstration battery of howitzers which we fired over recruits arriving from the Parris Island boot camp. I guess I was lucky, really, not only in surviving the grenade but in missing out on my division's next island fight, which was Iwo Jima. On Saipan before I got hit, only a few good friends of mine had been killed or maimed, but Iwo took a far bloodier toll.<br><br>I didn't feel lucky, though. I felt incomplete. I had been willing, and had gotten pretty good at handling the superb young Marines under my command, and at the work we did with instruments, maps, and guns. But I hadn't managed to last.<br><br>Two<br>A Mexican Interlude<br>(1946)<br><br>Fresh out of the Marines in late 1945, I spent some time at home in Fort Worth and then went to Mexico.

Here are their stories, from Dumas's <i>Three Musketeers</i> to America's founding fathers, including the New Orleans doctors who settled their medical disagreements under The Oaks, the short-lived newspaper editors of America's South and West, and certain twenty-first-century Parisian politicians.</p><p>The duel was essential to private, public, and political life. Where it was technically illegal, those who followed the elaborate codes of procedure were seldom prosecuted and rarely convicted: they were obeying a grand old tradition. <i>Gentlemen's Blood</i> is the definitive guide to this courtly violence, from an author called "a witty curmudgeon" by George Will and "a national treasure" by the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, whose style, according to <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, "fits somewhere between E.B. White and Andy Rooney."</p><p><b>A Smithsonian Magazine Selection.</b></p></p><p><p><b>Barbara Holland</b> is the author of thirteen books, most recently <i>Hail to the Chiefs</i>-a BookSense pick-and <i>They Went Whistling</i>. She lives in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>In dueling, the author of Hail to the Chiefs finds a surprisingly sturdy axis around which to connect historical figures and incidents as spokes. Holland wheels it all engagingly from the birth of jousting in the 12th century to October 2002 and Iraq's suggestion of a fight among national leaders rather than a war with the U.S. Her arguments about duels surviving in professional sports and business ventures are persuasive, but her anecdotes and digressions carry the narrative. Besides accounts of such famed duel winners as Jim Bowie-or losers, like Alexander Hamilton-she describes astronomer Tycho Brahe getting his nose sliced off, artist Caravaggio slaying a victorious tennis opponent and writer Alexander Pushkin canceling a gunfight in progress because of a snowstorm. Holland also uncovers unknowns with equally remarkable stories, the funniest of which depicts a battle between a man and a dog that "suspected" him of killing its master. Alas, Holland focuses more on the sport of dueling than its messy results. Although she claims duels left a third of their participants dead or seriously injured and that they were "hard on the widows and orphans," she fails to explore the bloody consequences in detail. And while some of her wistful ideas about gentlemen no longer being manly have merit, others, like honor being as antiquated as throwing "virgins down volcanoes," are overwrought. Perhaps the definitive work on dueling remains to be written, but until it arrives, this makes for a fun, fitfully enlightening ride. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Of Love and Shadows: A Novel</h2><p><p>Beautiful and headstrong, Irene Beltr�n works as a magazine journalist&#x2014;a profession that belies her privileged upbringing and her engagement to an army captain.

Now it&#39;s mainstream and an attractive proposition wherever you live. Fluffy little recycling units that eat weeds, bugs and scraps and turn them into organic eggs - what&#39;s not to love? Chickens are great backyard pets for young and old - they&#39;re a natural extension for everyone with a vegie patch, and for those who like eggs but are concerned about the welfare of commercial hens. This book is the perfect reference, whether you&#39;re already keeping chickens or an absolute beginner thinking about getting a couple of chooks. Dave Ingham offers compulsively readable advice on how to start, housing and feeding, settling chickens in with other pets, troubleshooting, and the (minimal) commitment required to keep your backyard hens healthy and happy.</p><p><p><b>Dave Ingham</b> (no relation to the food brand!) is the resident hen keeping expert on radio 702 Weekends with Simon Marnie, and runs Rent-a-chook, selling chickens coops and offering try-before-you-buy mini hen houses to Sydneysiders since 2001. Dave first got into hen keeping as an impoverished university student, when he and his mates planted a mega veggie garden - chickens were a natural extension. With home brewed beer, plentiful free vegetables and eggs, those students ate far better than their penury would otherwise have allowed. Some years, many chooks and a few houses later, Dave was invited to speak at a sustainability project about what he'd done to make his house more environmentally friendly. He was waxing lyrical about the benefits of keeping chickens and, on a whim, offered to lend an old coop and couple of hens to one of the group to try out. A no-commitment trial of chooks. Go on, give it a go! Somebody coined the term Dave's Rent-a-chook and it went from there. Since establishing Rent-a-chook in 2001, Dave has seen hen keeping go from a hippie pursuit to something very common and entirely mainstream.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Homeopathic Remedies For Stress</h2><p>Suggests homeopathic treatments for specific emotional states or physical causes of stress, and includes advice on avoiding and dealing with stress</p><p><b>Miranda Castro</b>, a practicing homeopath, is a member of the Society of Homeopaths, in England, and the author of "The Complete Homeopathy Handbook," She lives in England.<br></p><h2>Night Shift</h2><p><p>Late at night, when the owls are out, some people are awake-and doing all sorts of interesting things!</p><p>They are on the night shift.</p><p>Open this book, and you will discover the nighttime world of people who go to work when you are sleeping: </p><p>Street sweeper<br>Window dresser<br>Radio DJ<br>Security guard<br>Newspaper printer<br>Bridge painter<br>Zookeeper<br>Freighter captain<br>Truck driver<br>Road worker<br>Donut baker<br>Fisherman<br>Tug boat captain<br>Waitress</p><p>Come meet them all!</p></p><p><p>JESSIE HARTLAND is the author and illustrator of <i>Clementine in the City</i> and the illustrator of <i>The Perfect Puppy for Me</i> and <i>Drawing with Scissors</i>, both by Jane O'Connor.

In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis. In <i>The Red Tent</i>, Anita Diamant brings this fascinating biblical character to vivid life.</p><p>Told in Dinah's voice, the novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood-the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of Dinah's mothers-Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah-the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past.</p><p>With over 3.3 million copies sold, <i>The Red Tent </i>is a modern classic loved throughout the world, and now on screen as an A&amp;E/Lifetime mini-series.</p></p><p>The red tent is the place where women gathered during their cycles of birthing, menses, and even illness. Like the conversations and mysteries held within this feminine tent, this sweeping piece of fiction offers an insider's look at the daily life of a biblical sorority of mothers and wives and their one and only daughter, Dinah. Told in the voice of Jacob's daughter Dinah (who only received a glimpse of recognition in the Book of Genesis), we are privy to the fascinating feminine characters who bled within the red tent. In a confiding and poetic voice, Dinah whispers stories of her four mothers, Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, and Bilhah--all wives to Jacob, and each one embodying unique feminine traits. As she reveals these sensual and emotionally charged stories we learn of birthing miracles, slaves, artisans, household gods, and sisterhood secrets. Eventually Dinah delves into her own saga of betrayals, grief, and a call to midwifery.<p> "Like any sisters who live together and share a husband, my mother and aunties spun a sticky web of loyalties and grudges," Anita Diamant writes in the voice of Dinah. "They traded secrets like bracelets, and these were handed down to me the only surviving girl. They told me things I was too young to hear. They held my face between their hands and made me swear to remember." Remembering women's earthy stories and passionate history is indeed the theme of this magnificent book. In fact, it's been said that <i>The Red Tent</i> is what the Bible might have been had it been written by God's daughters, instead of her sons. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Anita Diamant is an award-winning journalist and author of six books about contemporary Jewish life, including <i>The New Jewish Wedding</i> and <i>Choosing a Jewish Life</i>.

Adam Bolitho, Admiral Richard Bolitho's nephew and heir, finds himself in command of Unrivalled, a new kind of frigate&#x2014;sleek, fast, and heavily armed.</p><p>Alexander Kent, pen name of Douglas Edward Reeman, joined the British Navy at 16, serving on destroyers and small craft during World War II, and eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant. He has taught navigation to yachtsmen and has served as a script adviser for television and films. His books have been translated into nearly two dozen languages.This remarkable reading of one entry in Kent's seagoing Bolitho series is excellent. Michael Jayston reads a story full of action and painful romance--his pace is measured, and yet his British voice breathes intensity and conviction. Like C.S. Forester's Hornblower, Admiral Bolitho is loosely patterned after the real historical figure, Lord Nelson, down to an adulterous scandal and manner of death. This book concentrates on a nephew, Captain Adam Bolitho, and the listener cannot put it down.

And when her fantasies take a violent turn, she wonders where wishes end and reality begins....</p><p>This book still haunts me. In a time when the Western world tends to either romanticize or villainize the customs of India, this book is an honest look into what life can be like for a woman who is not only in an arranged marriage, but also taken out of the only home she has ever known and thrown into not simply the United States, but New York City.

All four soldiers traveling with her died in the attack. Lynch, perhaps the most famous P.O.W. this country has ever known, was taken prisoner and held captive in an Iraqi hospital for nine days. Her rescue galvanized the nation; she became a symbol of victory, of innocence and courage, of heroism; and then, just as quickly, of deceit and manipulation. What never changed, as the nation veered wildly between these extremes of mythmaking, was her story, the events and the experiences of a nineteen-year-old girl caught up in what was and will remain the battle of her life: what she saw, what she felt, what she experienced, what she survived. <br><br><b>I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story</b> is the story this country has hungered for, as told by Lynch herself to Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author Rick Bragg. In it, she tells what really happened in the ambush; what really happened in the hospital; what really happened, from her perspective, on the night of the rescue. More than this, the collaboration between Lynch and Bragg captures who she is and where she&#x2019;s from: her childhood in Palestine, West Virginia, a lovely, rugged stretch of land always referred to as the hollow, where she rode horses, played softball, and was crowned Miss Congeniality at the Wirt County Fair the same year the steer she raised took a ribbon. It reveals her relationships with her older brother, Greg Jr., also an enlisted soldier, and her younger sister, Brandi; with her father, Greg Sr., a forty-three-year-old truck driver who has at times worked construction, cut hay, cut firewood, hauled timber, hauled concrete, run a bulldozer, run a backhoe, cleaned houses, and dug graves; and with her mother, Deadra, a city girl from Parkersburg who moved to the hollow and met her future husband when he was eleven and she was nine. And it describes what happened to the Lynch family in the agony of Jessica&#x2019;s capture and captivity; the terror and disbelief that cascaded through an entire town at the news of her disappearance into enemy hands; the joy of her rescue; and the long work of healing and recovery that lie ahead. Jessica Lynch has won the hearts and minds of Americans. In the hands of Rick Bragg, a renowned chronicler of American lives, her tale is told at last, with grace, and care, and astonishing candor.</p><p>Private First Class Jessica Lynch's capture and rescue during the 2003 war in Iraq captured the attention and captivated the emotions of millions of Americans. Accounts of the actual events surrounding Lynch were wildly varied as some took her to be a symbol of American righteousness while others made her out to be a pawn of the US military. But the Lynch that emerges in Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Bragg's portrayal is an ordinary young woman caught up in an extraordinary series of events. Bragg, who had the cooperation of Lynch and her family in writing <i>I Am a Soldier, Too</i> intersperses her war story with a detailed portrait of the diminutive kid from Palestine, West Virginia who enlisted to see the world. What's truly remarkable about Lynch is how relatively unremarkable she is. She had a normal working class childhood, did fine in high school, performed capably in basic training, made some good friends, met a guy, and, like thousands of her contemporaries, was sent off to a war zone in the Middle East. But the story takes a sharp turn when her vehicle loses the convoy it was following near Nasiriyah, her four fellow soldiers are killed in the subsequent fighting, and Lynch is badly wounded and taken prisoner. Blacking out for three hours, she awakes in an Iraqi hospital where the tensions of war coupled with a lack of resources and a language and culture barrier make for a harrowing stay even as numerous medical personnel defy their own military to protect her and save her life. Finally, American troops captured Nasiriyah, kicked down the hospital doors (even as hospital workers tried to give them a master key) and airlifted Lynch out. Bragg also tells the story of the blue collar West Virginia town of Palestine and the Lynch family who the world watches, first as Jessica goes missing, then when she is rescued, and finally when she returns amid much fanfare. Bragg keeps the story telling pretty simple, avoiding an analysis of how the story was spun or the politics behind the war itself. In the end, Jessica Lynch is not, by her own insistence, a hero. Rather, she is a soldier with a remarkable story of survival to tell. Thankfully, she has now had the opportunity to tell it herself. <i>--John Moe</i>Rick Bragg is the author of two best-selling books,<b> Ava&#x2019;s Man </b>and <b>All Over but the Shoutin</b>&#x2019;.

She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van de Oest was the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody. <br>Then out of the rain walked Spanner, an expert data pirate who took her in, cared for her wounds, and gave her the freedom to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore if she didn't want to be found: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but she paid for her newfound freedom in crime, deception, and degradation--over and over again. <br>Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and inventing her future.<br>But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's games one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van de Oest to be paid. Only by confronting her past, her family, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be....<br>In Slow River, Nicola Griffith skillfully takes us deep into the mind and heart of her complex protagonist, where the past must be reconciled with the present if the future is ever to offer solid ground. Slow River poses a question we all hope never to need to answer: Who are you when you have nothing left?</p><p>The dark and intensely involving story of a young woman&#39;s struggle for survival and independence on the gritty underside of a near-future Europe, by the author of Ammonite, which won the Tiptree and Lambda Awards.This is one of my favorite books I've ever edited--because it's extremely well written, deals with the near future in a realistic way, and has great characters, plus a narrative structure that's complex and interesting (unlike many SF novels). The science-fictional developments it tackles, primarily bioremediation, are on the cusp of happening today. The story really sucks you in.

Here's the good news: If his classic instructional can't change the diagnosis, it may at least ease the pain. Written by the master himself--no ghost ever stepped between Jones and his ball--as a series of twice-weekly newspaper columns between 1927 and 1935, the collection of tips and ideas moves from the simple ("Nobody ever swung a golf club too slowly") to the complex ("The art of appraising slope and speed--that is, of reading a green, can be derived only from experience"), the physical to the mental, the obvious to the arcane, and is penned with an elegance as smooth and fluid as Jones' liquid swing. Some of it, especially to golf's newcomers, will seem out of date--the game has changed much through the years--but that's OK; this is a book to savor as much as learn from. It's biggest drawback is its lack of illustrations, but the recent uncovering of a cache of unpublished photographs and tips--available in Jones' <i>Classic Instruction</i>--repairs <i>that</i> divot. Indeed, taken together, Jones' <i>On Golf</i> and <i>Classic Instruction</i> should cure several Royal and Ancient disorders. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>amateur golfer ever to play the game, this is essential instructional reading for the millions who have taken up golf during the 20 years this marvelous, timeless book has been out of print and unavailable.<br><br>B &amp; W line drawings.</p><h2>Getting to Know the Church Fathers: An Evangelical Introduction</h2><p>Augustine. Tertullian. Origen. For too many Christians such names are abstract, one-dimensional legends, innocuous voices from antiquity no longer relevant to modern needs and concerns. However, a closer look at these church fathers reveals writers whose reflections on the apostolic teachings edify all generations of believers. Bryan Liftin helps readers understand the fathers as individuals who cared deeply about preserving the core tenets of the Christian faith, and debunks misconceptions about their religious status and treatment of Scripture. An unveiling of these ten personalities demonstrates how much the fathers can teach us about the doctrines of our faith and the enduring community of which we are a part.</p><p>"A lively and engaging introduction to the church's earliest and most venerable teachers for evangelical readers. Shattering the stereotypes of the church fathers, Litfin shows that they were animated by the Holy Scriptures and love for Christ.<i>Getting to Know the Church Fathers</i> challenges evangelicals to claim the great tradition of Christian thought as their own and invites them to embrace it as their story and their heritage, not solely that of Catholics and Orthodox."<br>--<b>Robert Louis Wilken</b>, University of Virginia<br><br>"A new generation of evangelicals is discovering the riches of the wider Christian tradition, including the wisdom of the early church fathers.

In 1940, Moran became Churchill&#39;s doctor and his position as a one of history&#39;s most important war physicians was secured.

Considering the ruckus that everyone&#x2019;s making, and considering his exceedingly soft fingers, the gesture doesn&#x2019;t have much impact. With an exasperated sigh, he turns to Kermit for help. The frog climbs up onto a nearby wooden chair and shouts, &#x201c;Hey, everybody!&#x201d; Still no response, so Kermit turns to a shaggy short guy passing by. &#x201c;Hey, Animal,&#x201d; he pleads. &#x201c;Could I get a little help here?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Animal eagerly bounds up onto the chair and bellows: &#x201c;Quiiiiii-eeeeeet!!!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Well, that sure gets their attention, and in the silence that follows, Kermit cheerfully announces, &#x201c;Five minutes till we start!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The momentary quiet ends, erupting into a clamor as, around them, all manner of creatures frantically prep for the adventurous production ahead: a decidedly Muppet spin on eighteen enduring folktales collected and preserved by an enterprising pair of German brothers. Among the unorthodox sights before Kermit and Scooter are a blond flower child in caftan and Birkenstocks who&#x2019;s collapsing to the floor in a pretend, poison-induced stupor; a wedge of cheese and a blob of chopped liver running lines together; and, curled up on a sofa, a lazy snaggletoothed goat somehow dozing through it all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amid this, Kermit joins Scooter in helping Pep� the King Prawn locate a missing costume.

Is that the three-headed monster whose footsteps don&#x2019;t make any sound?&#x201d; Scooter nods yes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gosh,&#x201d; says Kermit, &#x201c;I thought you were taking care of that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Taking care of what?&#x201d; asks Tom, Dick, and Harry, who had somehow just appeared without a sound right behind them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Uhhhh,&#x201d; stammers Scooter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How do they <i>do</i> that?&#x201d; marvels Kermit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before anyone can answer, Miss Piggy struts over in her white karate outfit and says, &#x201c;Scooter, I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m tardy, but my martial arts class ran late. We were learning to break boards in half.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s groovy,&#x201d; says Janice from down by Piggy&#x2019;s feet and fresh from a fake faint. She lifts up on one elbow. &#x201c;Like, now you&#x2019;ll be able to protect yourself the next time a board attacks?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As I was saying,&#x201d; Piggy continues to Scooter, &#x201c;if you could just point me in the direction of the private dressing room reserved exclusively for <i>moi</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Scooter croaks, his throat suddenly very dry in the demanding diva&#x2019;s presence, &#x201c;there are nearly a hundred of us Muppets appearing in these stories, so space is awful tight around here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Piggy blinks three times then says slowly through a frozen smile, &#x201c;I do not understand how that pertains to <i>moi</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Scooter swallows hard and looks to Kermit for help.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You see, Piggy,&#x201d; begins the frog in soothing tones, &#x201c;you definitely have a private dressing room . . . though it&#x2019;s not so much a dressing room as it is a storage room . . . and instead of it being private, it&#x2019;s being shared by, well, everyone.&#x201d; The diva&#x2019;s impending outburst is interrupted when a blue blur crashes through the ceiling and hits the floor next to them with a resounding thud.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gonzo!&#x201d; cries Scooter as the fuzzy daredevil crawls out from beneath his cape and dusts himself off.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kermit eyes the hole in the ceiling. &#x201c;Were you skydiving?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not exactly. I call it &#x2018;cannonballing,&#x2019;&#x201d; Gonzo clarifies. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s skydiving without a parachute.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kermit&#x2019;s jaw drops. &#x201c;You jumped out of a plane with no parachute?!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aww,&#x201d; he counters with a dismissive flick of the wrist, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s the easy part.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the hard part?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hitting the ground.&#x201d; He rubs his shoulder. &#x201c;But I guarantee you I&#x2019;ll stick that landing eventually. What&#x2019;s that old saying? &#x2018;Thirty-third time&#x2019;s the charm&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Two elderly gents in three-piece suits stand a few paces away, scowling. &#x201c;You know, Gonzo,&#x201d; says the one called Statler, &#x201c;my nickname for you is &#x2018;the <i>Venus de Milo</i>.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gonzo cocks his head. &#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re not all there!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s for certain,&#x201d; says Statler&#x2019;s old pal Waldorf. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got my own name for him: &#x2018;peanut brittle.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why &#x2018;peanut brittle&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s half nuts!&#x201d; They both break into mirthful chortles.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aw gee, guys,&#x201d; says Gonzo, blushing a deeper shade of blue, &#x201c;this is no time for compliments, the stories are about to start!&#x201d; And off he goes to change into costume.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, as the stagehand Beauregard and his assistant penguins hammer away at various set pieces, an urgent and outraged voice cuts through the crowd noise. <i>&#x201c;Have you read this?!&#x201d;</i> Beau, the birds, and all the rest stop what they&#x2019;re doing and turn to see Sam Eagle marching across the room holding a sheaf of pages aloft in an upraised wing. The big blue raptor is visibly livid, his unibrow deeply furrowed. &#x201c;Have you actually read these twisted, bizarre, and violent tales that you&#x2019;re all about to appear in? Is this your idea of good, wholesome entertainment? Children being swallowed alive? Creatures tearing themselves in two? These stories are a hundred percent indecent!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Waldorf scoffs. &#x201c;And when was the last time the Muppets did anything even fifty percent decent?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The bird thinks for a moment. &#x201c;Point taken.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look, Sam,&#x201d; says Kermit, &#x201c;they&#x2019;re just stories, and the Muppets are born storytellers. These are some of the most beloved tales in the world, passed down for generations. They&#x2019;re the inspiration for countless books and movies, and they&#x2019;ve been translated into more than a hundred and sixty languages.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Globalism!</i> Harrumph!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But before Sam can declare another harrumph, Scooter swiftly adds, &#x201c;We were actually counting on you to be in one or two of them with us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh&#x2014;what? Really? You want <i>me</i> to be in them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The eagle is clearly quite flattered, so the stage manager forges ahead, handing him some pages from his clipboard. &#x201c;Here are the three we&#x2019;ve got you slated for.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sam glances at their titles and recoils. &#x201c;But these are some of the most objectionable stories of the whole lot! Terrible things happen in them!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kermit chimes in. &#x201c;These plots are pure make-believe, a marvelous mixture of allegories, metaphors, and symbols.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A loud crash from the corner makes them all turn. &#x201c;CYMBALS!&#x201d; yells Animal, who&#x2019;s seated at his drum set.

Their devoted daughter, Camilla, a fetching young chicken with a gentle demeanor and fine white feathers, roosted by her mother&#x2019;s bedside day and night.<br> &nbsp;<br> That morning, the chick overheard the doctor tell her father in solemn tones, &#x201c;Well, Angus McGonagle,&#x201d; for that was her father&#x2019;s name, &#x201c;the prognosis isn&#x2019;t good.&#x201d; They were talking about her mother&#x2019;s future, because there apparently wasn&#x2019;t going to be much of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the doc left, the ailing lady mustered up the strength to stammer, &#x201c;Always be . . . a good girl . . . my little Camillarella,&#x201d; which was her pet name for her daughter, &#x201c;and I will look down from heaven . . . and watch over you . . . but not in a creepy way.&#x201d; Then she kicked the bucket.<br> &nbsp;<br> A moment later, her mother asked in a weak voice, &#x201c;Who put that bucket so close to the bed?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Camilla&#x2019;s mom actually <i>did</i> pass away, she was planted in the backyard garden, right between the peas and the peppers. The little chicken went every day past the swing set and swimming pool to the grave and weeded and wept and ate the occasional earthworm, and she was always good and kind to everyone, just as her mother had implored.<br> &nbsp;<br> Time passed. The snow fell. Britney Spears had another comeback, fell from favor yet again, and came back once more. But Camilla always made her daily visits to the spot, and by the time the spring arrived, her father, a big-featured purple gent of gargoyle heritage, had gotten hitched again. Angus&#x2019;s new wife, a pleasingly plump glamour-puss called Miss Piggy, brought with her two kids of her own, Andy and Randy. Some might say these, uh, daughters were decent lookers, with their pale pink skin, pointy ears, and supersize snouts, but inside they were unquestionably selfish and arrogant.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I object!&#x201d; said Andy to Randy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because they called us selfish and arrogant?&#x201d; asked Randy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s accurate. I object to us having to play <i>girls</i> in this story&#x2014;we&#x2019;re <i>boys</i>!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s not a problem. Good actors can play anything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, and the problem is that we&#x2019;re terrible actors.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Piggy realized the jig was up and confessed: &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ll level with you. Scooter tried to get Betina and Belinda Cratchit for these parts, but they&#x2019;re booked in Reno. You have to take one for the team.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So with the arrival of Piggy and her two &#x201c;daughters,&#x201d; there began a very sorry stretch for poor little Camilla. One night at dinner, Andy said with a sneer, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so yucky how that feather-face eats food through her nose!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Randy, who at that moment was digging a finger in his own, jeered, &#x201c;Yeah, <i>gross</i>!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Camilla cowered and skulked out of the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> You might wonder about the poor chick&#x2019;s father at this point. Angus McGonagle had remained oblivious to the changes taking place in the household, blinded as he was by his love for Piggy (and here we are contractually obligated to make note of her mellifluous voice&#x2122;, mesmerizing blue eyes&#x2122;, and lustrous honey locks&#x2122;).<br> &nbsp;<br> The self-centered stepmother was no help, either. She focused only on her phone, obsessed with her Twitter feed. &#x201c;I just got retweeted by Dwayne &#x2018;The Rock&#x2019; Johnson,&#x201d; she once bragged to an empty room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Neither parent paid attention when Andy and Randy banished Camilla from the dinner table, or hid her fine clothes and gave her only an old gray frock to put on, or laughed at her and treated her like the scullery maid. She was forced to do all the hard work, rising even before daylight to bring the water, to wash the clothes, to cold-press Piggy&#x2019;s juices.<br> &nbsp;<br> Besides that, Andy and Randy plagued her in all sorts of other ways, from putting Pop Rocks in her grain to egging her in the yard with her own eggs. They frequently made fun of her nervous clucking and mocked her spotty plumage (she couldn&#x2019;t help it&#x2014;it was molting season). On the evenings when she was exhausted, which was every evening, she had no cushy hay to roost in, but was made to lie among the ashes on the stones by the hearth. This, of course, made her always dusty and dirty, so her stepsiblings made up names for her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Ash</i>-ley,&#x201d; shouted Randy. &#x201c;Get it? She&#x2019;s covered in ashes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Andy chimed in with one of his own: &#x201c;<i>Soot</i>-zanne!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Ember</i>-ly!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Burn</i>-adette!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Piggy had tried to tune out their brainless banter but could hold her tongue no longer. &#x201c;You might want to try using the word <i>cinder</i>&#x2014;<i>duh</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2018;Cinder-duh&#x2019;?&#x201d; asked Andy skeptically. &#x201c;Is that even English?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just <i>cinder</i>,&#x201d; said Piggy, with a roll of her eyes. &#x201c;Use the word <i>cinder</i> to make a name for her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are zero names you could make using the word <i>cinder</i>,&#x201d; said Randy, shaking his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be done,&#x201d; agreed Andy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; concluded Randy. &#x201c;Piggy, you&#x2019;re not very good at this, are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Piggy shook her head. &#x201c;If ignorance is bliss, why aren&#x2019;t you two happier?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was then that Angus announced he was taking a trip. The bagpipe enthusiast was planning to travel to a neighboring kingdom&#x2019;s annual wind-instrument convention. He asked Piggy&#x2019;s kids in his Scottish brogue, &#x201c;Is there anythin&#x2019; youse wee lasses would laik me to bring ya back from mah journey?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Video games!&#x201d; said Randy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And any chocolate except M&amp;M&#x2019;s!&#x201d; said Andy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with M&amp;M&#x2019;s?&#x201d; asked Angus.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Too hard to peel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aye, all right. And dear Camilla,&#x201d; said the father, &#x201c;what would ya like, me lass?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She thought for a moment, then whispered, <i>&#x201c;Bawk b-gaw, bawk bawk b-gark.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;d she say?&#x201d; asked Randy with a scoff.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She says she would laik the first twig that brushes &#x2019;gainst me tam-o&#x2019;-shanter when I turn back toward home,&#x201d; Angus replied, pointing to his soft woolen plaid cap. &#x201c;She is an awful simple gal.&#x201d; Randy and Andy looked at each other, marveling at such a silly request, and launched into guffaws.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the convention ended and he&#x2019;d piped to his heart&#x2019;s content, Angus bought for Piggy&#x2019;s oddball offspring the v...</p><h2>Haunted House and Other Short Stories</h2><p>Virginia Woolf?s intention to publish her short stories is carried out in this volume, posthumously collected by her husband, Leonard Woolf.

The story was totally captivating. I love the way we started by meeting Dora, and were given just enough information about her to grow to like her and then she&#x2019;s taken away from us. I guess that&#x2019;s kind of how her life was. The reader feels just like the people of Dodge City must have felt, to lose her so early and tragically.&nbsp; Then we meet the posse. The names are all familiar but their stories not as well known. To hear them swap stories between themselves, then to read their histories, gets us to understand how it is that they are all here at this particular time and together for this event.

Our greatest presidents are the ones who confronted a national crisis and mobilized the entire nation to face it. That&#x2019;s the conventional wisdom. The chief executives who are celebrated in textbooks and placed in the top echelon of presidents in surveys of experts are the bold&#x201d; leaders the Woodrow Wilsons and Franklin Roosevelts who reshaped the United States in line with their grand vision&#x201d; for America.<br><br>Unfortunately, along the way, these great&#x201d; presidents inevitably expanded government and shrunk our liberties.<br><br>As the twentieth-century presidency has grown far beyond the bounds the Founders established for the office, the idea that our chief executive is responsible to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States&#x201d; has become a distant memory.<br><br>Historian and celebrated Reagan biographer Steven F. Hayward reminds us that the Founders had an entirely different idea of greatness in the presidential office. The personal ambitions, populist appeals, and bribes paid to the voters with their own money that most modern presidents engage in would strike them as instances of the demagoguery they most feared one of the great dangers to the people&#x2019;s liberty that they wrote the Constitution explicitly to guard against. The Founders, in contrast to today&#x2019;s historians, expected great presidents to be champions of the limited government established by the Constitution.<br><br>Working from that almost forgotten standard of presidential greatness, Steven Hayward offers a fascinating off the beaten track tour through the modern presidency, from the Progressive Era&#x2019;s Woodrow Wilson to Barack Obama. Along the way, he serves up fresh historical insights, recalls forgotten anecdotes, celebrates undervalued presidents who took important stands in defense of the Constitution and points the way to a revival of truly constitutional government in America.<br><br>What you didn&#x2019;t learn from your history teacher, but will find in <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to the Presidents</i>:<br>Progressive hero Woodrow Wilson aired a pro Ku Klux Klan movie at the White House<br>Calvin Coolidge, much mocked by liberal historians as a bland Babbitt, was the last president to write his own speeches, guided the country through years of prosperity and limited government, and was one of the most cultured men ever to live in the White House<br>Why Eisenhower&#x2019;s two biggest mistakes as president were, in his own words both sitting on the Supreme Court&#x201d;<br>How as president JFK took mind altering drugs, many of them prescribed by a physician he called Dr. Feelgood,&#x201d; who later lost his medical license for malpractice<br>Nixon&#x2019;s hysterically vilified Christmas bombing of North Vietnam in 1972 caused very few civilian casualties and compelled North Vietnam to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War<br>The misunderestimated George W.

But beginning with Woodrow Wilson in the Progressive Era, some chief executives have actively sought to undermine the Constitution, and in recent years many presidents have been negligent or simply ignorant about their constitutional responsibilities.<br><br>In <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to the Presidents</i>, presidential historian Steven Hayward revives the original standard for judging our presidents. You&#x2019;ll not only discover which presidents get an F on their efforts to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, but also learn about some of the underappreciated constitutional heroes who have been elected to the White House.<br><br>Along the way, you&#x2019;ll also learn:<br>How the much ridiculed Calvin Coolidge was actually one of our most intellectual presidents, reading classics in the original Greek and Latin for relaxation at night in the White House<br>How Herbert Hoover, a strong anti-Communist, may have assured the success of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia<br>Why Eisenhower deliberately stumbled his way through his rare press conferences<br>How Barack Obama wanted to include Hiroshima and Nagasaki on his world apology tour, but the Japanese government said no thanks<br><b>Steven F.

He moved to Australia in 1969 where he in short order helped to fight a bushfire, shook hands with an astronaut, and became convinced he&#x2019;d become a geologist and live on Mars. It&#x2019;s not surprising that he fell in love with science fiction early, or that he spent far too much time reading. He went on to graduate from college with an interesting but not particularly useful arts degree, but had met people that led him directly into science fiction itself. He coedited and copublished&nbsp;<i>Eidolon</i>, an award-winning Australian semiprozine, in the 1990s before starting to work for&nbsp;<i>Locus</i>&nbsp;in 1997. That led directly to Jonathan becoming a reviewer, and going on to edit nearly 100 books. He has won the World Fantasy, Aurealis, Ditmar, and Locus Awards, and has been nominated 15 times for the Hugo Award.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think the Tilborans would have more sense,&#x201d; snapped Bhayar. &#x201c;Some of them, anyway.&#x201d; His dark blue eyes appeared almost black in the dim light of the small study that adjoined his receiving chamber. In the midafternoon of summer, the air barely moved, even with the high arched ceilings, and when it did, it only brought the smells of the city up the hill to the palace overlooking the harbor of Solis. He walked to the map displayed on the wooden stand, scowled, and then looked to the man in scholar&#x2019;s brown. <br>&#x201c;Why would you think that?&#x201d; Quaeryt replied in the formal Bovarian in which he&#x2019;d been addressed, as always. He smiled politely, his thin lips quirking up slightly at the corners. Despite the itching of his slightly-too-long nose, he did not scratch it. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bait me, scholar.&#x201d; The Lord of Telaryn added only a slight emphasis to the last word. &#x201c;Tell me what you have in mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Only your best interests, my lord.&#x201d; Quaeryt shifted his weight off his slightly shorter left leg. The higher heel of his left boot helped, but the leg ached when he stood for long periods. <br>&#x201c;When you talk like that, you remind me of the sycophants who surrounded my sire in his last days.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why might they have talked like that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Answer my question!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have you considered why I&#x2014;or they&#x2014;would avoid answering a demand delivered so forcefully?&#x201d; Quaeryt grinned. <br>Abruptly, Bhayar laughed. &#x201c;There are times&nbsp;&#x2026; friend or no friend&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Every time anything went wrong in Tilbor immediately after your sire conquered it, his first solution was to issue an edict. If that didn&#x2019;t work, he killed people.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It worked, didn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It did indeed. It still does. But&nbsp;&#x2026; exactly how many of your soldiers are stationed in Tilbor and not on the borders with Bovaria? How many weeks would it take to get the companies from Tilbora or Noira to Solis&#x2014;if you had enough ships to carry them?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I could commandeer merchantmen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How long before they became as unhappy with you as the Tilborans are?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t turn to Kharst.&#x201d; Bhayar laughed. <br>&#x201c;Not until they forget what he did to the Pharsi merchants in Eshtora. How long will that be? As long as you&#x2019;ve had garrisons in Tilbor?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quaeryt! Enough of your questions. You&#x2019;re as bad as Uhlyn was. Scholars and imagers! A ruler can&#x2019;t live with them, and a strong one can&#x2019;t live without them. You&#x2019;ll turn my hair as white as yours.&#x201d; A fist outsized for the lord&#x2019;s wiry frame slammed onto the pale goldenwood of the desk. <br>That was always Bhayar&#x2019;s rejoinder when he tired of dealing with the issues behind the questions, Quaeryt mused behind a pleasant smile, and never mind the fact that Quaeryt&#x2019;s hair was white blond and that he was actually a year younger than Bhayar, who had just turned thirty. <br>&#x201c;Namer&#x2019;s demons, I hate Solis in the summer. I&#x2019;d even prefer the mist stench of Extela when the winds blow off the mountain.&#x201d; <br> <i>Mist stench?</i> Abruptly, Quaeryt recalled that some of the ancient volcanoes north of the old capital occasionally still belched ash and fumes. <br>Bhayar blotted his forehead with a linen cloth already soiled in more places than not, for all that it had been fresh and white at noon. &#x201c;Instead of raising all these questions, why don&#x2019;t you offer an answer?&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt grinned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall your asking for one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m asking now. What do you suggest, my friend, the so-knowledgeable scholar? Tell me what I can do to remove the troops from Tilbor without immediately inviting another rebellion?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let me think about it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think too long.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;After breakfast&#x2014;eighth glass of the morning,&#x201d; suggested Quaeryt, knowing that was too late for the early-rising lord. <br>&#x201c;Seventh glass. I still don&#x2019;t see why you don&#x2019;t want to stay in the palace. I&#x2019;ve offered far better quarters than you have on Scholarium Hill&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The quarters are indeed better, but I&#x2019;d end up being of no help to you.&#x201d; <i>Or to me.</i> &#x201c;And rulers soon tire of friends or retainers who outlive their usefulness.&#x201d; That was accurate, but not the real reason for his determination to avoid the palace for as long as possible. &#x201c;Besides, you&#x2019;d want me to get up at the Namer-fired glass that you do.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that lazy. You just like me to think you are.&#x201d; <br> <i>You and everyone else.</i> &#x201c;But I am. I don&#x2019;t work the way you do. I&#x2019;m just an itinerant scholar fortunate enough to have schooled some with the Lord of Telaryn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bah&nbsp;&#x2026; we&#x2019;ll let everyone else think that.&#x2026;&#x201d; Bhayar blotted his forehead again. &#x201c;Why did he insist on moving the capitol here?&#x201d; Before Quaeryt could have answered, not that he had any intention of doing so, the lord went on, &#x201c;I know. I know. A port city on a big river and a good harbor makes more sense for trade and for moving armies. And Grandmere&#x2026;&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to like it.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt wondered about what Bhayar might have said about his grandmother, but decided not to ask. He&#x2019;d pressed enough. &#x201c;Tomorrow at seventh glass, then, sire?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; Bhayar shook his head, but then grinned again. <br>&#x201c;I hear and obey.&#x201d; Quaeryt&#x2019;s words were light, verging on the sardonic. <br>As he left the study and entered the private corridor separating the receiving hall from the study, Quaeryt forced himself to walk without limping, uncomfortable as it was, but he tried never to limp in the palace or when he was around Bhayar. He glanced into the large chamber, on the third level, the highest one in the palace, where, when necessary, Bhayar sat on the gilded throne that had been brought from Extela by his sire sixteen years before and received visitors or handed down formal pronouncements or sentences. Even the wide windows didn&#x2019;t help much in keeping the chamber cool in the height of summer. <br>Quaeryt made his way to the west end of the private corridor, where the palace guard unlocked the iron-grille door, allowing the scholar to make his way down the windowless and stifling staircase, past the grille door on the second level to the main-level grille door. Another guard unlocked that door as well. Quaeryt stepped carefully along the shaded and colonnaded walk that bordered the west end of the palace gardens, taking his time so that he could enjoy the cooler air created by the fountains. His enjoyment was always tempered by the knowledge that oxen&#x2014;and sometimes prisoners&#x2014;turned the capstan-like pumps that lifted the water to the reservoirs on the uppermost level at the rear of the palace. He was careful not to look into the gardens. After passing the guard at the top of the side steps, he walked down to the gate used by favored vendors and visitors to the palace. <br>&#x201c;Good day, scholar,&#x201d; offered the taller soldier of the two at the gate in accented Bovarian. <br>&#x201c;The same to you. I don&#x2019;t envy you in this heat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of the mist from the gardens drifts down here. It&#x2019;s better than the main gate, let me tell you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can imagine.&#x201d; Quaeryt smiled and stepped out onto the wide stone sidewalk below the wall, a sidewalk that bordered the north side of the stone-paved avenue. <br>Across the avenue to the south and below the palace were the public gardens, open to those suitably attired, according to the judgment of the palace guards stationed at the two entrances. There weren&#x2019;t that many fountains there, and the cooler venues would already be taken. He turned right and started back toward the hill to the west, close to a vingt away, that held the Scholarium Solum&nbsp;&#x2026; and the Scholars&#x2019; House. <br>The one-legged beggar boy was a good two blocks west of the palace grounds. Beggars weren&#x2019;t allowed any closer. <br>Quaeryt flipped a copper to the beggar boy. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s from Lord Bhayar.&#x201d; His words were in common Tellan. <br>The beggar frowned. <br>The scholar flipped a second copper. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s from me, but you wouldn&#x2019;t have either without your lord.&#x201d; <br>The beggar looked at the coppers. &#x201c;Could you a gotten &#x2019;em any dirtier, lord scholar?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Complaints, yet? Next time I might try.&#x201d; Privately, Quaeryt was pleased. It was easier to image a shiny copper than a worn and grubby one, not that anyone would have cared about coppers, but coppers added up to silvers, and silvers to golds, and few would think that a scholar who had dirty coppers was actually imaging them. <br>The scholar studied the avenue ahead of him, taking in the pair of youthful cutpurses, seemingly playing at bones, on the far side of the flower vendor, and the drunken lout who lurched out of the tavern. His appearance was timed too well and he was just a tad too tipsy. Quaeryt imaged a patch of fish oil onto the heels and soles of his polished boots, just before the fellow reached him. <br>The man&#x2019;s heels slipped from under him, and the slam-thief flailed before hitting the stones of the sidewalk. &#x201c;Friggin&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2026; sow-slut&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Obviously, the would-be grabber was having a slow day. Otherwise, he wouldn&#x2019;t even have bothered with a scholar&nbsp;&#x2026; unless he knew who Quaeryt was. That could be a problem. <br>&#x201c;Do you need help?&#x201d; Quaeryt asked, expecting the usual knife. <br>As the man tried to scramble to his feet and the knife appeared, Quaeryt imaged out a sliver of steel, and the useless blade separated from the hilt, and haft and blade clunked on the stones&#x2014;just as the thief&#x2019;s boots slid out from under him again and he crashed face-first onto the sidewalk. He moaned, but didn&#x2019;t move for a moment, and Quaeryt skirted his prone figure, stepping into the avenue and barely avoiding a carriage before regaining the sidewalk. He&#x2019;d gotten a good look. He just hoped he didn&#x2019;t have to deal with the thief again. That was one problem with using imaging to create accidents. Some people didn&#x2019;t learn. They just blamed their bad luck and went on doing stupid or dangerous things. <br>Although Quaeryt walked at a good pace, he didn&#x2019;t strain, and he was only sweating moderately when he reached the point where the avenue passed in front of the hill on which the so-called Scholarium Solum was set. The Scholars&#x2019; House was halfway down the hill on the west side. Quaeryt glanced up the hill to the dark red brick building that held the Scholarium Solum as he walked past it to the winding walk up to the Scholars&#x2019; House, no longer bothering to hide the slight limp he&#x2019;d always had. <br>The brick steps of the front entry had shifted slightly over time, and Quaeryt had to take care as he climbed them onto the front porch because his bad leg had a tendency to drag. The wide-roofed porches that encircled the Scholars&#x2019; House were designed to pick up the sea breezes, but since the sea breezes brought red flies in the day and mosquitoes at twilight, not to mention all the less than savory smells of the harbor, few scholars ventured out onto the porches once the sun dropped behind the warehouses and factorages to the west. <br>Quaeryt made his way to the east porch, the most shaded one in the afternoon. <br>There a younger man in a grayish purple shirt and trousers looked up from his wooden straight-backed chair. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hot walk from the palace. I still don&#x2019;t see why Lord Bhayar doesn&#x2019;t offer you quarters.&#x201d; Voltyr spoke in Bovarian, as did all scholars, at least with each other and in dealing with the palace and other high officials. He was several years younger than Quaeryt, how many Quaeryt didn&#x2019;t know exactly. He&#x2019;d never asked. <br>&#x201c;Would you want to live in the palace, Voltyr?&#x201d; asked Quaeryt as he settled into the chair across from the younger man. <br>&#x201c;No. You know that. You&#x2019;re a scholar. Scholars&#x2019; Houses are the only place for imagers, and they&#x2019;re not even half-safe in some cities, even here at times. Do you know what it was like when my parents discovered I could image a copper?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I imagine they were upset and pleased all at once.&#x201d; Quaeryt had heard enough that when he&#x2019;d done his first imaging&#x2014;after hearing about imagers from old Scholar Geis, he&#x2019;d tried to image a cake, and it had tasted like mud&#x2014;he&#x2019;d done it alone. But then, all his imaging had been in secret and painfully discovered by trial and error when the scholars who raised him were not around. <br>&#x201c;They were just upset. In a month, I was here, being told not to image until I was older&nbsp;&#x2026; but no one could help me. They just told me to be careful.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t that many imagers. What about Uhlyn?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The only thing he ever said was not to image large things and not to try imaging anything out of metal until I had a beard and then to begin with small items.&#x201d; Voltyr laughed harshly. &#x201c;He was so careful about his imaging, but look what happened to him, even with Bhayar&#x2019;s protection.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t careful about other things. He flaunted being an imager.&#x201d; Even as Quaeryt spoke, he understood how many people feared imagers and their seemingly wondrous ability to visualize something and then have it appear. What so few wanted to understand was how painfully few imagers there were or how much skill and strength and concentration it took to image the smallest of objects, and how most imagers could do little beyond that. But&nbsp;&#x2026; those who could&nbsp;&#x2026; they were feared and shunned, and often the target of anyone who knew their abilities. <br>&#x201c;Oh&nbsp;&#x2026; and it&#x2019;s all right for merchants and High Holders to flaunt what they are, but not imagers? Even scholars can flaunt their knowledge.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not without risk,&#x201d; returned Quaeryt. &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t like to be reminded of what they don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s why Scholars&#x2019; Houses are also the safest place for scholars. Good scholars ask questions. Questions upset rulers and those who fawn on them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Scholars in favor can gather in golds,&#x201d; pointed out Voltyr. <br>&#x201c;Golds aren&#x2019;t much use to a headless man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask questions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of being a scholar, then?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How about the good life&nbsp;&#x2026; or the best life possible for someone who wasn&#x2019;t born a High Holder?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;High Holders are captive to their wealth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quaeryt&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;d like to be held captive like that.&#x201d; <br>The scholar laughed, then sat there for several moments before asking, &#x201c;What do you know about Tilbor?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Most of it is cold. The people are rude and crude, and they don&#x2019;t like strangers. They don&#x2019;t like scholars and imagers, except that they like Telaryn soldiers even less. They like to fight a lot, except when they&#x2019;re drinking, and they do a lot of that in the winter because it&#x2019;s too cold to do anything else. Even Antiagon Fire wouldn&#x2019;t warm Noira in midwinter.&#x201d; The imager frowned. &#x201c;Why are you asking?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking of going there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why, for the sake of the Nameless?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;To learn about it, to try to resolve something for Lord Bhayar. Besides, I&#x2019;ve been seen at the palace too much in the past few seasons. That&#x2019;s getting to be a problem.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a problem half the High Holders in Telaryn would like to have.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They only think they want that problem. They don&#x2019;t know Bhayar.&#x201d; <br>Voltyr frowned. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not that arbitrary or cruel. Certainly not like his father, is he?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s generally very fair. Most High Holders aren&#x2019;t. But neither forgets <i>anything</i>.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt stood. &#x201c;Do you want to go down to Amphora later? I have a few spare coppers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How could I refuse such an invitation?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; laughed the scholar. &#x201c;Half past fifth glass? I have work to do later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re paying.&#x201d; <br>With a last smile, Quaeryt turned and walked toward the north porch, hoping the nook by the north chimney wall would be vacant. Both Bhayar&#x2019;s and Voltyr&#x2019;s comments about imagers had played into the half-formed idea in his thoughts. Why, indeed, did imagers have to move and act with such care? Could he do anything about that? Or, at least, about his own position? <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2011 by L. E.

What&#x2019;s wrong with boats? they said.&#x201d; But the project goes ahead, and public opinion swings around to support it. Eggers&#x2019;s featherlight humor provides laughs throughout, as in the description of the bridge&#x2019;s steel parts journeying through the Panama Canal: It was a long trip, but the pieces of steel did not mind, for they are inanimate objects.&#x201d; Although the Navy wants to stripe the bridge black and yellow, and most people expect it to be gray, Irving Morrow, the project&#x2019;s idiosyncratic champion, defends the vivid orange of the steel&#x2019;s anti-rust paint, making the proclamation that gives the book its title. Nichols&#x2019;s (Crabtree) construction-paper cutouts and hand-lettering provide a series of puckish visual counterpoints for the story&#x2019;s two important messages: that situations and objects that appear unchangeable do, in fact, come from somewhere, and that adults can squabble even more foolishly than children.

The cursive blue-paper word drawings also included, in English and French, complement the purely visual works by conveying the spirit of Bourgeois&#x2019; writing in extraordinary pictorial forms.

Sam Pickett never expected to settle in this dried-up shell of a town on the western edge of the world. He&#39;s come here to hide from the violence and madness that have shattered his life, but what he finds is what he least expects. There&#39;s a spirit that endures in Willow Creek, Montana. It seems that every inhabitant of this forgotten outpost has a story, a reason for taking a detour to this place--or a reason for staying. - Amazon</p><p>TRABER BURNS is a native of Louisiana, who began his acting career as a graduate of the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco.&nbsp; He spent 30 years working in regional theatre, including the New York, Oregon, Alabama and Dallas Shakespeare Festivals.&nbsp; After 5 years of acting in Los Angeles, he now lives in Oregon where he spends most of his time transporting his son to various activities.In this originally self-published hit, the small town of Willow Creek, Mont., is the place where dreams go to die. English teacher and basketball coach Sam Pickett hasn't won a game in five seasons and decides to quit coaching, but he changes his mind after getting a look at the 6-ft.-11 Norwegian exchange student, Olaf Gustafson. Sam's other recruits include Tom Stonebreaker, whose drunken father would rather see him working the family farm, and Peter Strong, who moves in with his hippie grandmother after his parents' divorce and would rather be back home in Minnesota with his girlfriend. As the team coalesces around Olaf and begins winning games, their march toward the state tournament inspires Willow Creek and ignites a touching romance between Sam and his assistant coach. If the novel is a little too long, its sentiments worn too shamelessly on its sleeve, and its symbolism a little too obvious (Sam dubs the team bus "Rozinante" in honor of Don Quixote's steed), this uplifting story about the triumph of human decency is sure to be enjoyed by those who fondly recall another David vs. Goliath roundball yarn--Hoosiers.

Lawrence Osborne comes for the cheap dentistry. Broke (but no longer in pain), he finds that he can live in Bangkok on a few dollars a day. And so the restless exile stays. <br><br>Osborne&#x2019;s is a visceral experience of Bangkok, whether he&#x2019;s wandering the canals that fill the old city; dining at the No Hands Restaurant, where his waitress feeds him like a baby; or launching his own notably unsuccessful career as a gigolo. A guide without inhibitions, Osborne takes us to a feverish place where a strange blend of ancient Buddhist practice and new sexual mores has created a version of modernity only superficially indebted to the West. <i>Bangkok Days </i>is a love letter to the city that revived Osborne&#x2019;s faith in adventure and the world. <p></p></p><p><p>LAWRENCE OSBORNE has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and other publications, and is the author of five previous books. Born in England, he lives in New York.</p>Chapter One <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Wang Lang <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>A few years ago I lived in a neighborhood called Wang Lang. From where I sit now, watching trains cross to Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge, my river balcony in Bangkok seems like a patch of paradise forever lost. Disassembled and stowed away in a hopeless corner of the mind, where it's bound to rot. At this very hour, when New York seems filled with threatening drama and artificial colors, the Chao Phraya River is filled with gentle monks bobbing around on water taxis. The two cities couldn't be more different. There, saffron is the color of dusk. The river brings peace. The monks got off at Wang Lang pier with their umbrellas and mala rosaries, which traditionally contain 108 beads for the 108 passions of men enumerated by Avalokiteshvara. They looked up at the farang drinking his gin and tonic on the balcony, and that look contained both amusement and distance as it asked, "Is that a lonely man?" The look of Buddha as he extends protection with his left hand raised, abhaya. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I preferred nights there. The days were too hot and I like heat only when there's no sun. I was a night walker. It is a loneliness which has been chosen and indeed calculated. I spent the small hours on the streets, marauding like a raccoon. I grew to like the atmosphere of stale basil and exhausted marijuana which Bangkok seemed to breathe out of invisible nostrils; I liked the girls who spin past you in the dark with the words "Bai nai?" like coins that have been flipped in a bar. I liked the furious rot. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I woke up from a siesta in a small white room in the apartment complex called Primrose Apartments. I didn't keep much there. A cut-price Buddha from the Chatuchak market, a bookshelf. I had a carpet from India, too. When you are broke, life is simple. I made myself a gin and tonic on the balcony and waved to the monks. The days were empty by design. I didn't have a job; I was on the lam, as old American gangsters had it. A perfect phrase. The lam. It means "headlong flight," according to my Webster's dictionary. Lamming, to run away. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Across the hallway lived an Englishman called McGinnis. I wondered if that was a real name, or whether it was a borrowed one. He had an air of upper-class twittery, with his polelike physique stripped of muscle and his linen whites which had missed their era by a wide mark. McGinnis sold air-conditioning systems to Bangkok conference centers and hotels, a profitable business in sweltering Bangkok, and afterhours he said he was compiling an encyclopedia of bars to enrich the lives of others. He looked like a dirty cat at that hour, and I'd see him sitting on his balcony, slowly drinking a Singha mixed with some kind of fruit cordial and eating olives. He looked me in the eye and smiled, as if stroking a cat as well as being one. On the other side was a Spaniard called Helix. Helix&#x2014;not Felix? I thought I'd heard him correctly. Helix the painter, who painted frescoes behind bars in Bangkok conference centers and hotels. They were typical of the profound, talented men you find in Bangkok. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>There were others. On the ground floor lived another expat, an older Scot called Farlo who ran a holiday lodge which he had built himself for adventurous types, in Cambodia. He was a former British Army paratrooper from Dundee, and he wore a beret on the side of his head. Inside that head was lodged a piece of shrapnel from the war in Angola. Cuban shrapnel. You didn't want to cross him drunk in the corridor at night. He'd grab your arm and say, "It's time for a wank, son." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>At six every night I went down to the street, feeling very much like John Wilmot, earl of Rochester, perfumed from a cold shower. The Primrose opened directly into the street, the way that an elevator opens directly into a penthouse. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Wang Lang is a pandemonious place in a pandemonious city. Its main drag is so narrow you can feel both sides of it brushing against your hips as you walk through it. As I went sweating between the open kitchens, I was followed by children jeering, "Yak farang, yak farang!" (foreign giant). I was the largest human there, a phenomenon in their eyes, and perhaps worse than that, a genetic accident which couldn't be reversed. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It was a hospitable place for a man who has done nothing, and who will probably never do anything. For someone with no career, with no prospects, permanently broke, it was the perfect asylum. Its gold-tinted eggs and its bags of oolong tea were virtually free. One could graze continuously on delicasies one had never heard of and still be in pocket. It was well suited to a lazy cunt, in other words, and a natural habitat for a man on the lam who had no objective in his day-to-day life but an inquisitive loitering, a selfless promenading for its own sake. A man who has turned into a ruminant, a goat. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In Wang Lang I perfected that Thai style of eating on the run called khong kin len, where you pile different ingredients onto a banana leaf as you sail along, walking and pondering at the same time, never losing balance. The streets are culde-sacs, so there is no point in having a direction. They all end in little theaters and caf�s by the water. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>And so I found myself walking up and down, eating those gilded eggs and bits of dried squid, and as night fell the air went ash-gray and the nostrils opened to greet something indefinable, the pungency of "mouse shit" chilies being tossed in hot oil and tamarind paste, and I began to sink like a stone into my own well. The city is nothing more than a protocol for this sinking. Because Bangkok is where some people go when they feel that they can no longer be loved, when they give up. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It was also true of the other tenants. Broken, disappointed, rejected, they had headed east. During my first nights in Wang Lang I played chess with them in the common room, interested by their dazed, suntanned faces. My most favored, however, was McGinnis. He was a man with no past, a character in a Simenon novel who walks out of his house one day, gets on a train, and kills someone in a distant city. He was from Newhaven. "There's nothing in Newhaven," McGinnis would say, "except sea fortifications," and his face was like that of a pleasant hoodlum who has just shot down a kite. Sea fortifications, I would think: but that's a lot. His head was shaved like a soldier's, like Farlo's, but he was nothing of the sort, with his willowy, elongated frame. He was an engineer with a degree in air-conditioning. It's a subject you can get a degree in. He had acquired his in Sheffield. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>McGinnis was six foot seven. He towered in doorways, in hotel lobbies, in the light of streetlamps. There was something wonderfully sinister there, and I love sinister men. A sinister man doesn't just walk down a street, he rolls down it like a superior ball bearing. A sinister man cannot be amiable, but he can be good company. Despite his association with the science of air-conditioning, McGinnis was also subtly aristocratic and refined, while doing nothing better with his life than selling mass-produced cooling units. It was okay with him. There are aristocrats of the spirit who are mundane in their daily lives. Everything about him was happily self-contained, replete. Is this what made him sinister? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It was hotter than usual around Christmastime. In the supermarkets, choirs of girls in red velvet dresses swung brass bells in fur-trimmed hats and chimed out the words to "Silent Night" and "Jingle Bells." The tofu bars had sprigs of plastic holly on them and yuletide slogans crisscrossed the steaming skycrapers of a Buddhist city. The days were windless, our river surged past the Primrose, sloppy and violent, the color of pea soup into which a baby has puked. Its surface was thickened by strands of aquatic weed, and on the far bank the city temples rose like huge stalagmites, or legumes with bristling skins. Somerset Maugham, one of the few Western writers to describe Bangkok in detail, says somewhere that one should be grateful that "something so fantastical exists." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Something stirred within me whenever I took my coffee on the balcony in the morning and inhaled the river stench of gasoline and mud. As if a dead leaf on the floor of me were suddenly being lifted and flipped with a small sound, a scratching of dead matter coming to life again. A pricking of the inner lining of the gut. I watched the rice barges crashing toward Klong Tuey port, the gossiping monks with their umbrellas and briefcases ferrying back and forth from those same temples strung out along the river. And behind them the four gold towers of the Royal Palace and, more distantly, Wat Arun sparkling with reflections from a million fragments of glass and ceramic rosebuds, with the sugary ornament of the Italian craftsmen who fashioned them two and a half centuries ago. Monks and schoolchildren in navy blazers, and the men operating the boats blowing ear-splitting whistles as they swept up to the pier. As the tires slung along the boat struck the rotting wood, there was a delicious sound: phuck. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>From here I saw McGinnis doing yoga on his balcony in a jumpsuit, his body elongated to its full length and a trickle of Khmer music coming out of the sliding doors. It was impossible to avoid the other renters at the Primrose because we were always thrust together by the lack of space. He stayed in his yoga position and called over, in his long-exiled accent, "I hear a Spanish guy moved in downstairs the same time as you. He says his name's Helix. Not Felix, Helix." And he laughed scornfully. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Before long, McGinnis was taking me downriver on the water taxis to the Oriental Hotel. He dressed up for these river rides, a straw hat and two-tone Loake shoes with steel caps. The Death in Venice look. He spoke to schoolgirls in appalling, salacious Thai. The hotel has its own pier, and we jumped off there with all the fat tourists. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"I can understand," he said, "you not having a salary and all." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>One sometimes starts explaining oneself immediately to someone one has just met. I seem to have the knack for triggering this reaction. I started coming to Bangkok, I said, in order to get dental care, because I couldn't afford the insurance in New York. It was as simple as that. Fourteen cavities and a root canal cost me $450 in Bangkok, which was a fraction of my yearly insurance premium. Even with the airfare and a month's rent at the Primrose, I was in pocket. My whole rationale for being there, in fact, was financial. It was money that governed my temporary exile, for the math was clear-cut: the West was now far too expensive. With time, I was coming closer to the idea that I might have to find somewhere like this to live on a permanent basis. In Thailand, I was in pocket most of the time. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Is that what you say? In pocket?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>He laughed. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Did you have your teeth done this time?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"I am waiting for a check." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Oh, you're waiting for a check!" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>McGinnis took me to the Bamboo Bar. He took out a mechanical toy and placed it on the bar. It was a Brazilian tree frog made of wood, and it chattered on a spring if you pushed a button. He left it there. "Sooner or later," he said, "some beautiful woman always comes up and asks me what the frog is. And then I tell her." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"What is it?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"I'll tell you later." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The decor of the Bamboo is rattan and lacquer, for the word "colonial" has nothing but positive connotations in Asia these days, and everything colonial is deemed handsome, stylish. The Bamboo Bar is the most touristy bar in the city, so touristy that it seems to wink at itself, so it is also the most colonial. But since everything is touristy anyway why not direct yourself to the wellhead of the poison and enjoy? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>When I came here with McGinnis we were always surrounded by commotion. People came up to him and kissed him, shook my hand, and announced themselves as members of the professions that dominate Bangkok: fashion, design, finance, and food. When I came alone, however, the place always seemed to be empty and I passed hours watching farang women doing laps in the swimming pool. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>When I was alone, I wandered the hotel. There was usually a string quartet in a lobby that was animated without being animate. Too many of the rich, scurrying about with their hands full, too many bellhops, too many Japanese matrons in white gloves playing cards. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I took the underground corridors deep inside the hotel where you could see streams bubbling over beds of pebbles, past the windows of Burberry. In the Authors Wing there was a white summerhouse atrium and a staircase leading up to the suites named after the writers that all Asian hotel suites are named after: Conrad, Maugham, Agatha Christie. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>There was no Jeffrey Archer suite yet, but in the library there was a portrait of the great novelist as Lord of Westonsuper-Mare. I sat by the grandfather clock and read Evelyn Waugh's A Tourist in Africa. "No one ever made a servant of a Masai," Waugh wrote of his journey through Kenya in 1959. It's a mysterious sentence. To walk for the sake of walking&#x2014;the most aimless thing of all&#x2014;reminds us why the Masai cannot be servants: they are nomads. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>McGinnis stopped his chattering frog and said, "Long before you came here I was in the same predicament. I wanted a place I could wander about in and where nothing would add up. European cities were too familiar. American cities were too like European ones. I wanted a city with no streets. A script I couldn't read. Total oblivion." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>One night recently, he said, he had heard a curious sound coming from the Spaniard's apartment. When he turned off the radio and went down the stairs to investigate, he could tell that it was the Spaniard's voice. It repeated a single word over and over, and it was almost in a scream. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"He was shouting mierda, mierda!" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"What do you make of that?" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>He went to the window of the Spaniard's apartment, which wasn't in the least curtained or shuttered. You could look right in. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"The Spaniard was in his underpants in front of a large canvas slathered with glue. He held a dead pigeon in one hand, which he appeared to be in the act of hurling at the canvas. I noticed at once that there were other dead pigeons already pinned to its surface. I realized then that he must have collected them from the streets nearby, which, as I am sure you have noticed, are fairly awash with dead birds of all descriptions. Pigeons, macaws, crows. I have even seen the occasional parrot. In any case, he had decided to make art out of everyday life." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"Isn't that the definition ...</p><h2>The American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition (21st Century Reference)</h2><p>�Over 70,000 entries<br>�Thoroughly revised and updated<br>�1,000 new words and meanings<br>�Over 400 photographs and illustrations<br>�Expert guidance on correct usage<br><br>Based on the bestselling <b>American Heritage</b>� <b>Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</b><br><br>American Heritage� dictionaries are widely known as the most innovative and informative dictionaries in today's market. This all-new fourth edition of the best-selling classic continues that tradition with its clear and precise definitions, its expert usage guidance, and its wealth of illustrations. Newly updated to reflect our changing language, this revised edition is the most up-to-date and authoritative dictionary available today.<br><br>�More than a thousand new entries for such terms as <i>e-tailer, zine, bioreserve, chatroom, red card, domestic partner </i><br><br>�More biographical and geographical entries than any other paperback, thoroughly updated for the new millennium<br><br>�The most lavishly illustrated dictionary on the market -- with over 400 images<br><br>�Expert usage guidance based on the American Heritage� Usage Panel<br><br>�Regional notes from around the country<br><br>�Hundreds of synonym lists, fascinating etymologies, and much more<br><br>American Heritage� Dictionaries. Setting a new standard.</p><p>The latest edition of the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> is out, and that's hot news--not just for the resolute followers of lexicographical minutiae, but for the general reading and writing public as well. Why? Because the <i>American Heritage</i> is a long-standing favorite family dictionary (never underestimate the value of pictures) and one of the prime dictionary references for magazines, newspapers, and dot.com content providers. For scads of writers and editors across the U.S., it sets the standard on matters of style and lexicographical authority.<p> So this new edition is exciting and noteworthy, but how good is it? In its favor, the fourth edition is as current a dictionary as you can get. It's six years fresher than the 1994 version, with 10,000 words and definitions you won't find in the still venerable but now slightly dated third edition. For example, unlike its predecessor (and also unlike the 1996 <i>Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary</i>), this fourth edition covers <i>dot-com</i>, <i>e-commerce</i>, and <i>soccer mom</i>, <i>Ebonics</i>, <i>Viagra</i>, and a <i>surf</i> definition for cruising television channels and the Internet.</p><p> Its panel of special consultants includes authorities on anthropology, architecture, cinema, and law, plus military science, music, religion, and sports, and that is reflected in an impressively comprehensive coverage of the arts, culture, and technology. Sadly, however, there are no medical consultants on the panel, and that loss is felt in some substandard medical definitions. Other flaws: there's a greater than usual tendency to define a word with a form of the same word--for example, <i>fuzzy</i>, whose first two definitions are "1. covered with fuzz." and "2. of or resembling fuzz." And some definitions seem needlessly wordy, such as the entry for <i>furious</i>, which is "full of or characterized by extreme anger; raging." Compare that with the more succinct <i>Oxford Encyclopedic</i> entry: "1. extremely angry. 2. full of fury."</p><p> On the other hand, there are valuable entries throughout the dictionary supplying additional information on synonyms, usage, or word history, and these extras, such as the history of <i>diatribe</i> and the usage notes on <i>discomfit</i>, are interesting. The layout is easy on the eyes, with dark blue/green bold type setting the words apart from their definitions, and 4,000 color photographs, maps, and illustrations that are both useful and delightful. On one page, the margin provides color depictions of Francis Bacon, bacterium, and a Bactrian camel. Theodore Roosevelt and a rooster share another margin, while a third page offers Isak Dinesen, a dingo, and dinoflagellate. It is a fascinating book to peruse, and a compellingly scholarly addition to the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> line. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>"This new<b> American Heritage </b>is more suited to our national character than any other previous dictionary."<br>-- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>Searching for the Original Bible</h2><p><p>Noted researcher/archaeologist Randall Price tackles crucial, faith&#x2013;challenging questions about the Bible&#x2019;s claims to be divine communication. All dispute boils down to two fundamental issues: Were the original writings given by God, or were they cobbled together from traditions, myths, and human ethical notions? And if divine, have they been faithfully passed down to us?</p> <p>Price brings his expert knowledge of the Bible texts to examine crucial topics:</p> <ul> <li>what the key ancient manuscripts reveal</li> <li>ideas about how mere humans composed the writings</li> <li>evidence from the archaeological record</li> <li>the gathering of inspired texts into one book</li> <li>the transmission of those texts to us</li> </ul> <p>All evidence available today, concludes the author, upholds even more strongly the age&#x2013;long views of orthodox Christianity. Not only is the Bible we have a trustworthy record of divine revelation, but it remains living and authoritative for every time, every place, and every person.</p></p><p>Price, president of World of the Bible Ministries and author of such works as <i>Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls</i> and <i>Unholy War</i>, has declared war on critics of the Bible. Writing from a conservative evangelical Christian perspective, he defends the integrity of the Scriptures against popular writers like Dan Brown (<i>The Da Vinci Code</i>) as well as serious scholars like Bart Ehrman (<i>Misquoting Jesus</i>). To many students, the issue of biblical inerrancy&#x2014;generally understood to mean that the original manuscripts of the Bible are without error&#x2014;is something of a red herring. We don't have those manuscripts; how can we know that they are free from error? Price admits that we likely would not profit much by having these manuscripts and claims the copies we have are reliable. Instead, he gives the reader a scholarly, though very readable, defense of existing translations. He goes beyond the question Can we trust the Bible? and takes a serious look at the canonization process, the abundance of translated resources available to Bible students, the impact of extra-biblical resources and the consistency of Bible translations over thousands of years. Many charts and graphs aid the reader in putting all the information together. This is a fine book for lay and professional readers alike. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book presents a comprehensive account of the art in Greek lands from the early Bronze Age down to the Hellenistic period. The gems are related to history and to the artistic achievements in other media of their day, and the subject matter of the scenes engraved upon them is examined and found to hold much that will be new to students of Greek myth and iconography. The development of the Bronze Age studios in the Minoan and Mycenaean world is discussed, and the works of the great period of Classical gem engraving are resolved into their styles and schools, with a special chapter devoted to Greek works within the Persian Empire. The attributions and discussion are supported by full notes and lists. The plates, which show the gems enlarged up to four times their natural size, present the fullest possible range of devices and styles from all periods. This revised edition will be an essential work of reference for students and scholars, as well as a thorough survey of the subject for all lovers of Greek art. 1395 illustrations, 51 in color.</p><p>John Boardman, Lincoln Professor Emeritus of Classical Archaeology and Art at Oxford University, has written widely on the art and archaeology of ancient Greece.

From revolutionizing the NFL's business model to helping transform the league into the nation's most popular sport, Jones is a sports icon, and this book showcases and brings clarity to the scope of his impact.</p></p><p>In 1989 the Dallas Cowboys were struggling to keep their heads above water, both on and off the field. Three straight losing seasons, falling revenue, and the crumbling finances of owner H.R. &#34;Bum&#34; Bright had left &#34;America&#39;s Team&#34; a shadow of its former self. That February, Bright announced he had made a handshake deal to sell the team for $140 million to an Arkansas oilman named Jerry Jones. Nearly two decades later, Jones has turned the Cowboys into the most profitable sports franchise in the world; sports three Super Bowl rings won during the 1990s with two different coaches; and has overseen every detail involving the team&#39;s new $1.2 billion home in Arlington, Texas, a stadium the likes of which no sports fan has ever seen. Along the way, Jones&#39;s aggressive, creative ideas combined with a colorful cast of coaches and players to completely revolutionize the NFL&#39;s business model, helping to transform the league into the nation&#39;s most popular sport. Acclaimed author David Magee (How Toyota Became #1) was granted an all-access pass to the Cowboys organization, the team&#39;s locker room, and to Jones himself. The result is Playing to Win, an unprecedented and compelling look at the inner workings of the Cowboys, the NFL, the business of sports, and the man with the ambition and drive to turn the playing field upside down. Playing to Win is an enlightening, behind-the-scenes narrative featuring the true story behind Jones&#39;s purchase of the team; the firing of legendary coach Tom Landry; the fallout between Jones and coach Jimmy Johnson; the team&#39;s attitude toward acquiring controversial stars, including Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens, and Adam &#34;Pacman&#34; Jones; and Dallas&#39;s approach to merchandising, marketing, and stadium financing. Playing to Win is a must-read for serious football fans and anyone with a desire to understand the modern world of pro sports.<b>David Magee</b> is the author of nine nonfiction books, including <i>How Toyota Became #1</i> and <i>Endurance: Winning Life's Majors the Phil Mickelson Way</i>.

Flawn Series in Natural Resource, 9)</h2><p><p>As a changing climate threatens the whole country with deeper droughts and more furious floods that put ever more people and property at risk, Texas has become a bellwether state for water debates. Will there be enough water for everyone? Is there the will to take the steps necessary to defend ourselves against the sea? Is it in the nature of Americans to adapt to nature in flux?</p><p>The most comprehensive&#x2014;and comprehensible&#x2014;book on contemporary water issues, <em>A Thirsty Land</em> delves deep into the challenges faced not just by Texas but by the nation as a whole, as we struggle to find a way to balance the changing forces of nature with our own ever-expanding needs. Part history, part science, part adventure story, and part travelogue, this book puts a human face on the struggle to master that most precious and capricious of resources, water. Seamus McGraw goes to the taproots, talking to farmers, ranchers, businesspeople, and citizen activists, as well as to politicians and government employees. Their stories provide chilling evidence that Texas&#x2014;and indeed the nation&#x2014;is not ready for the next devastating drought, the next catastrophic flood. Ultimately, however, <em>A Thirsty Land</em> delivers hope. This deep dive into one of the most vexing challenges facing Texas and the nation offers glimpses of the way forward in the untapped opportunities that water also presents.</p></p><p>Seamus McGraw is the author of The End of Country: Dispatches from the Frack Zone and Betting the Farm on a Drought: Stories from the Front Lines of Climate Change.

McGraw&#x2019;s work is similarly nuanced, thoroughly researched and beautifully written. .&nbsp; . McGraw showcases a deep understanding of Texas law, history and culture. There&#x2019;s a desire not just to explain where we stand now, but how we got here." (<i>Texas Observer</i> 2018-05-02)<br><br>"Water is set to become the world&#x2019;s most important commodity.&nbsp;It will be access to water that will determine which communities thrive. It will be the ability of state and local governments to set and enforce water conservation policies that will determine the long-term viability of the quickly growing cities and suburbs being planted in the desert. . . we need to worry about the right things. . . Start worrying about water." (<i>Inside Higher Ed</i> 2018-05-10)<br><br>"McGraw's book proves that the United States simply isn't ready for the next big drought or flood.

(<i>Block Island Times</i> 2018-06-01)<br><br>"In stark prose that often gleams like a bone pile bleached in the sun, McGraw travels back and forth across Texas to give a free-ranging but deadeye view of the crisis on the horizon." (<i>Texas Monthly</i> 2018-07-01)<br><br>"It&#x2019;s hard to write about the slow creep of environmental crises like drought without resorting to shock tactics or getting lost in the weeds...[McGraw] draws out the conflicts in compelling ways by drilling into the plight of individual water users. Even if you feel no connection to Texas, these stories are relevant to every part of the country." (<i>Outside</i> 2018-07-17)<br><br>"Interviewing both scientific experts and everyday water users, [McGraw] clearly delineates the competing interests, describes political and geological reality, and makes a compelling argument for statewide water policy that utilizes modern technology and fairly weighs parochial needs against the good of the whole."

Its most prominent feature is the rise of financial profit, in part extracted from households through financial expropriation. Financialized capitalism is also prone to crises, none greater than the gigantic turmoil that began in 2007. Using abundant empirical data, the book establishes the causes of the crisis and discusses the options broadly available for controlling finance.</p><p><b>Costas Lapavitsas</b> is a Professor of Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

Taylor provides an in-depth examination of the development of urban environments, and urban environmentalism, in the United States. Taylor focuses on the evolution of the city, the emergence of elite reformers, the framing of environmental problems, and the perceptions of and responses to breakdowns in social order, from the seventeenth century through the twentieth. She demonstrates how social inequalities repeatedly informed the adjudication of questions related to health, safety, and land access and use. While many accounts of environmental history begin and end with wildlife and wilderness, Taylor shows that the city offers important clues to understanding the evolution of American environmental activism.<p></p><p>Taylor traces the progression of several major thrusts in urban environmental activism, including the alleviation of poverty; sanitary reform and public health; safe, affordable, and adequate housing; parks, playgrounds, and open space; occupational health and safety; consumer protection (food and product safety); and land use and urban planning. At the same time, she presents a historical analysis of the ways race, class, and gender shaped experiences and perceptions of the environment as well as environmental activism and the construction of environmental discourses. Throughout her analysis, Taylor illuminates connections between the social and environmental conflicts of the past and those of the present. She describes the displacement of people of color for the production of natural open space for the white and wealthy, the close proximity between garbage and communities of color in early America, the cozy relationship between middle-class environmentalists and the business community, and the continuous resistance against environmental inequalities on the part of ordinary residents from marginal communities.</p></p><p>"All future research on environmentalism and social change will have to reference <i>The Environment and the People in American Cities</i>. It is a pathbreaking, first-rate work of scholarship. As the first scholar to consider the relationship between social inequality and conservation issues within such an inclusive framework, Dorceta E. Taylor makes stunning links between the terrain of contemporary environmental and social-justice conflicts and those of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."--<b>David Pellow</b>, author of <i>Garbage Wars: The Struggle for Environmental Justice in Chicago</i>&#34;Dorceta E. Taylor has set out to write nothing short of a &#39;People&#39;s Environmental History of American Cities.&#39; At the core of her social history are inequalities based on race, gender, class, and ethnicity, as wealthy white elites shaped access to housing, workplaces, parks and even cemeteries to their wishes, at the expense of everyone else. Taylor&#39;s book is a call for broader perspectives on environmental issues, to include segregation, labor market and workplace dynamics, social movements, politics, and social control. A magnum opus chock full of fascinating details of an untold history of the environmental injustices at the root of our society.&#34;--Timmons Roberts, Director of the Center for Environmental Studies, Brown University</p><h2>On Christmas Eve (Cape Light)</h2><p><b> The loveliest gift of the year-the new Christmas novel set in the beloved town </b> <br><br> Lucy and Charlie's relationship has been on the rocks, but just as Lucy's about to call it quits, a runaway teenager crosses her path.

Much has been written about Rashi and his grandsons, the Tosafot, but almost nothing of his daughters. Legend has it that they were learned in a time when women were forbidden to study the sacred texts. Rashi&#39;s Daughters tells the story of these forgotten women.</p><p>"Rashi's Daughters" is the story of the three daughters of the great Talmudic authority Salomon ben Isaac, a.k.a. Rashi, who lived in 11th century Troyes, France and had no sons. At a time when most women were illiterate and the rare educated woman was one who could read the Bible, Rashi's daughters studied Talmud. They were also vintners, merchants and mothers of the next generation of Talmudic scholars.<p> </p><p>Built on seven years of exhaustive historical research and ten years of Talmud study, "Rashi's Daughters" explores what might have been, weaving actual events, as described in responsa literature and Talmud commentaries, into an account of the lives of these amazing women. Talmud is an integral part of these novels; readers will learn along with Rashi's daughters as he explains selected texts. This is also the story of the medieval French Jewish community, how they lived, loved, worked, ate, prayed and interacted with their non-Jewish neighbors. A wealth of material about Jewish women's daily lives is provided, including how they observed life cycle events and holidays.</p><p> </p><p>I wrote this book because I wanted to share my research into Jewish women's lives in medieval France, how the prosperity and tolerance they enjoyed differed from the negative stereotypes usually associated with the Middle Ages. In addition, I wished to encourage women to study Talmud, the foundation of Jewish Law that, until very recently, women have been unable to access. I hoped to share the excitement and pleasure Talmud study can engender.</p>Praise for RASHI'S DAUGHTERS: JOHEVED <p> </p><p>Recently, a new book titled Rashi's Daughters, written by Maggie Anton, has taken the torch from Anita Diamant, while using more research to explain the phenomenon that is Rashi and his daughters. - The Jewish Newsweekly of Northern California </p><p> Anton does for the time of Rashi what Milton Steinberg did for the Tannaim in As a Driver Leaf ... This historical novel will especially appeal to Jewish women, but it teems with information that I certainly did not know before ... Anton's enthusiasm for her subject is infectious, and I came to care about the characters, as well as the relevant application of Talmudic argument. - Rabbi Laurence Edwards, CCAR Newsletter </p><p> </p><p>Joheved, the eldest of Rashi's three daughters, has a secret wish, something that is strictly forbidden to Jewish women in 11th-century France: she seeks to study the Talmud. For years, Joheved has watched enviously as her father, the great scholar Rashi, teaches the Talmud to male students ... Like a mirror held up to the past, this first volume in a trilogy draws readers into the lives of medieval French Jewish women; much like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, it delves into the rituals of women who were forgotten by history and marginalized by society. - Library Journal </p><p> One can begin to wonder if Anton was a fly on the wall, so realistic are her characterizations. Rashi's Daughters was written in celebration of the 900th anniversary of the yahrzeit of the great talmid chacham, who was known in his time to have taught Talmud to members of his family -- his daughters! ... Anton not only recreates a medieval French community but is faithful to many little-known details of Jewish ritual, including marital relations, childbirth, life-cycle events and holidays. In Rashi's time, a daughter was "chattel" and had only a choice of refusal to a marriage, but Yocheved was strong-willed and intellectual. So she was allowed to choose decidedly unfeminine studies, as well as marriage to a young man who wanted his intellectual match, not merely a betrothed servant to bear his young... Anton spent years on her own Talmud study that has enabled her to craft a beautiful story that captures the essence of the times and lives of her protagonists ... For us -- hours of enjoyable reading. - The Jewish Press </p><p> Anton takes on a formidable task in her novel Rashi's Daughters. She spent seven years gathering research and it shows. The immersion into the world of 11th-century Troyes, France, is complete. She describes the politics of counts, the making of parchment, the hand soap made from mutton fat and the use of moss instead of toilet paper ... I am particularly grateful for Anton's vivid and careful research into the winemaking profession, which throws a fascinating light on the everyday life of Rashi and his family. - World Jewish Digest </p><p> A labor of love by new author Maggie Anton brings the world of medieval French Jewry to life, touching upon everything from parchment-making and Tallmudic discourse to midwifery and grape harvests. ... Anton creates characters who engage us with their ideas and their struggles. In the tradition of Diamont's The Red Tent, this is historical fiction that brings our heritage as Jewish women closer to home. Rashi himself leaps off the margins of the Talmud page to take shape as son, husband, father and grandfather. With a compelling combination of drama, suspense and romance, Anton takes her readers on a journey to Troyes, France during the eleventh century. While frequent reference to ghosts, amulets and magic potions remind us that we're in the medieval world, the characters also experience timeless concerns: pre-wedding jitters, a grandmother's dementia, problems of religious coexistence, and the struggle to balance individual goals and family needs. - Lilith Magazine </p><p> </p><p>I just finished reading Maggie's wonderful book over Shabbat and enjoyed it immensely. I also learned a great deal. She really painted a wonderful scene of Jewish life in medieval France and I loved the characters. Congratulations - it's a wonderfully imaginative and informative book. - Devorah Zlochower Director of Programs, Drisha Institute, NY </p><p> </p><p>With her crisp and straightforward language, Maggie Anton quickly transports her reader into 11th-century France and the female-dominated household of Rashi, the respected Talmud scholar ... Rashi's Daughters is an engaging read on many levels and will appeal to a variety of audiences ... Fans of The Year of Wonder will find many similarities and readers of The Red Tent will be intrigued by the story. - Atlanta Jewish Times </p><p> </p><p>Rashi's Daughters offers readers a glimpse into a fascinating world - a Jewish community in medieval France - and explores the lives of a famous scholar and his (unfortunately) not-so-famous daughters. Anton's extensive research and her imagination combine to retrieve the lives of Jewish women in a way that is both realistic and captivating. This book is a must-read for Jewish women and others seeking to better understand women's religious lives. - Dvora Weisberg, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Rabbinics, HUC-JIR </p><p></p><p></p><p>For those of us who study the classic texts of the Jewish tradition, Bible and Talmud, Rashi's commentary is the indispensable guide. But we tend to forget that this eleventh century French scholar is more than a name on the printed page. He was also a husband, father, grandfather and entrepreneur who lived during one of the most fascinating periods in medieval Jewish history, and who had feelings, frustrations and hopes much like ours today. In her novel, Ms. Anton has brought this man, his family, his century and his entire social setting to life in a vivid and colorful way. No one who reads this novel will ever read Rashi's writings in the same way. This is a stunning accomplishment! </p><p>- Dr. Neil Gillman is Professor of Jewish Philosophy at the Jewish Theological Seminary</p></p><h2>Once-A-Day Devotional for Teens</h2><p><p>Are you looking for way to connect with God daily that fits your schedule?

Reprint.</p><p><i>Walking the Bible: A Journey by Land Through the Five Books of Moses</i> is the story of Bruce Feiler's 10,000-mile trek from Mount Ararat to Mount Nebo, undertaken for reasons he did not understand at the outset and accompanied by a companion who was very nearly a stranger. In the book's first chapter, in characteristically understated style, Feiler suggests a viable parallel to his journey: <blockquote>Abraham was not originally the man he became. He was not an Israelite, he was not a Jew. He was not even a believer in God--at least initially. He was a traveler, called by some voice not entirely clear that said: Go, head to this land, walk along this route, and trust what you will find.</blockquote><p> Feiler, a fifth-generation American Jew from the South, had felt no particular attachment to the Holy Land. Yet during his journey, Feiler's previously abstract faith grew more grounded. ("I began to feel a certain pull from the landscape.... It was a feeling of gravity. A feeling that I wanted to take off all my clothes and lie facedown in the soil.") Feiler's attentiveness, intelligence, and adventurousness enliven every page of this book. And the lessons he learned about the relationship between place and the spirit will be useful for readers of every religious tradition that finds its origins in the Bible. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>Bruce Feiler is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Walking the Bible, Learning to Bow, Looking for Class,</i> and <i>Under the Big Top.</i> A frequent contributor to NPR's <i>All Things Considered,</i> and contributing editor for <i>Gourmet</i> he writes regularly about American music for <i>The New York Times, The New Yorker,</i> and other publications, and recieved international acclaim for his influential cover story in The New Republic, "Gone Country."

We tend socially to avoid engaging with people unlike ourselves, and modern politics encourages the politics of the tribe rather than of the city. In this thought-provoking book, Richard Sennett discusses why this has happened and what might be done about it.</p><p>Sennett contends that cooperation is a craft, and the foundations for skillful cooperation lie in learning to listen well and discuss rather than debate. In <i>Together</i> he explores how people can cooperate online, on street corners, in schools, at work, and in local politics. He traces the evolution of cooperative rituals from medieval times to today, and in situations as diverse as slave communities, socialist groups in Paris, and workers on Wall Street. Divided into three parts, the book addresses the nature of cooperation, why it has become weak, and how it could be strengthened. The author warns that we must learn the craft of cooperation if we are to make our complex society prosper, yet he reassures us&nbsp;that we can do this, for the capacity for cooperation is embedded in human nature.</p></p><p>The highly respected author of <i>The Craftsman</i> now explores how we can create a better society by learning to truly listen and cooperate with others, even when our interests are conflicting.<p>Praise for Richard Sennett&#x2019;s <i>The Craftsman</i></p> <p>"In <i>The Craftsman</i>&nbsp;[Sennett] compellingly explores the universe of skilled work, where 'the desire to do a job well done for its own sake' still flourishes."&#x2014;Brian C.

Back then, Miami Beach was just a quiet, backwater town -- folks stopped in to chat and for a top-notch fish sandwich and fries. This, of course, was only the beginning, and what happened next is a story worth telling.<br><br>You see, Joe discovered that the stone crab was not only edible but perfectly delectable -- and he was the first to serve them up in a way that simply could not be beat: chilled with Joe's special mustard sauce and/or drawn butter. Then the town began to boom, with movie crews filming in the area and big entertainers and wealthy vacationers flocking to Miami Beach, and Joe's son Jesse came on the scene. With a heart and smile so big he could win over anyone who walked through the door, Jesse brought the celebrities in to Joe's by the carload. Growing up right in the middle of this was Jesse's daughter, Jo Ann -- who runs Joe's today.<br><br>For 80 years, no visit to Miami has been complete without stopping in at Joe's Stone Crab.<br><br>From the beginning, it has always been the love of food, family, and friends that has brought in customers and kept them coming.

Where did they come from, when did they get here, and how did they settle the Americas? Until three years ago, the Clovis people were credited as the pioneers, arriving across the Bering land bridge at the end of the last Ice Age, no earlier than 12,000 B.C. Now that standard scientific account has been demolished.As the principal investigator since 1977 at Monte Verde, Chile, the most important site in overturning the old theories, Thomas Dillehay spent many years being dismissed for his insistence on the presence of impossibly ancient human artifacts dating back 20,000 years. In the past few years he has been soundly vindicated, and in this book he presents a highly readable account of who the earliest settlers are likely to have been, where they may have landed, and how they dispersed across two continents.</p><p>Archaeology is radically rewriting American prehistory. Since 1932, when exquisite stone points were first discovered at Clovis in New Mexico, accepted theory has asserted that humans did not begin to populate the New World until the retreat of glaciers that were blocking entry from Asia about 12,000 years ago. Then, in 1997, a group of archaeologists confirmed that objects found preserved in a peat bog in the far south of Chile--stone tools, bones, even chunks of mastodon meat--could securely be dated to at least 12,500 years ago. In <i>The Settlement of the Americas</i>, Thomas D. Dillehay--the archaeologist who excavated this material--gives his reasons for believing that people reached the Americas before the ice sheets moved south more than 20,000 years ago. It is a fascinating detective story based on tantalizingly meager data, one in which logic and a powerful imagination are required to fill vast blank areas in the geography and prehistory of two continents. The author sets the scene at a time when so much water was locked up in glaciers that coastlines were several hundred feet lower than they are now. Scientific studies such as stone-tool technology, linguistics, and genetics are used to build an overwhelming argument. Academic battles can be as bitter as any others, and the author is ruthless in his demolition of rival theories. Every scientist has his own bias, and this study is heavily weighted toward South American evidence, but Dillehay's interpretations appear to be objective and well-argued. <i>The Settlement of the Americas</i> answers basic questions, such as who were the first Americans and how did they colonize an empty land, in an exciting and readable way. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Thomas D. Dillehay is Professor and Chairman of Anthropology at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. He has been Principal Investigator at the Monte Verde site in Chile and is the author of the two-volume work Monte Verde: A Late Pleistocene Settlement.</p><h2>Herbal Well-Being: Simple Recipes for Making Your Own Herbal Medicines, Aromatherapy Blends, and Herbal Body-Care Formulas</h2><p>Book by Wardwell, Joyce A., Breedlove, Greta, Dodt, Colleen K.</p><p></p><h2>Chosen Poems, Old and New</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Here are the words of some of the women I have been, am being still, will come to be,&#x201d; writes Audre Lorde of this volume, in which she brings together many of the most important poems she has written over the past thirty years.</strong></p><em>Chosen Poems</em> is also, Lorde says, &#x201c;a linguistic and emotional tour through the conflicts, fears, and hopes of the worlds I have inhabited.&#x201d; Among those worlds are such earlier books as <em>The First Cities</em>, <em>Cables to Rage</em>, <em>From a Land Where Other People Live</em>, <em>New York Head Shop and Museum</em>, and <em>Coal</em>. &#x201c;Only the worlds of Africa scrutinized in <em>The Black Unicorn</em>, too complex for excerpt, have been excluded.&#x201d; The volume also includes seven new poems.

Yet that is just what essayist Janisse Ray delivers in her memorable debut, a memoir of life in a part of America that roads and towns have passed by, a land settled by hardscrabble Scots herders who wanted nothing more than to be left alone, and who bear the derogatory epithet "cracker" with quiet pride.<p> Ray grew up in a junkyard outside what had been longleaf pine forest, an ecosystem that has nearly disappeared in the American South through excessive logging. Her family had little money, but that was not important; they more than made up for material want through unabashed love and a passion for learning, values that underlie every turn of Ray's narrative. She finds beauty in weeds and puddles, celebrates the ways of tortoises and woodpeckers, and argues powerfully for the virtues of establishing a connection with one's native ground.</p><p> "I carry the landscape inside like an ache," Ray writes. Her evocations of fog-enshrouded woods and old ways of living are not without pain for all that has been lost--but full of hope as well for what can be saved. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>A native of the coastal plains of southern Georgia, author Janisse Ray grew up in a junkyard. Her book, "Ecology of a Cracker Childhood" (Milkweed 1999), a unique combination of memoir and natural history, captures two Souths--the cracker south and the longleaf south--both vanishing and both worthy of remembrance. <p>A naturalist and environmental activist, Ray has participated in The Orion Society's Forgotten Language Tour. She has published essays and poems in magazines and newspapers such as "Georgia Wildlife", "Orion", "Wild Earth", "Tallahassee Democrat", "Missoula Independent", "Florida Wildlife", "Hope", and "Florida Naturalist".

E. Hotchner visited a close friend in the psychiatric ward of St. Mary's Hospital. It would be the last time they spoke - three weeks later, Ernest Hemingway returned home, where he took his own life. Their final conversation was also the final installment in a saga that Hemingway had unraveled for Hotchner over years of world travel.</p><p>Ernest always kept a few of his special experiences off the page, storing them as insurance against a dry-up of ideas. But after a near miss with death, he entrusted his most meaningful tale to Hotchner, so that if he never got to write it himself, then at least someone would know. In characteristically pragmatic terms, Hemingway divulged the details of the affair that destroyed his first marriage: the truth of his romantic life in Paris and how he gambled and lost Hadley, the great love he'd spend the rest of his life seeking.</p><p>But the search was not without its notable moments, and he told of those, too: of impotence cured in a house of God; of back-to-back plane crashes in the African bush, one of which nearly killed him, while he emerged from the other brandishing a bottle of gin and a bunch of bananas; of cocktails and commiseration with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Josephine Baker; of adventure, human error, and life after lost love. This is Hemingway as few have known him - humble, thoughtful, and full of regret.</p><p>To protect the feelings of Ernest's wife, Mary, who was also a close friend, Hotch kept these conversations to himself for decades. Now he tells the story as Hemingway told it to him. Hemingway in Love puts you in the room with the master and invites you to listen as he relives the drama of those young, definitive years that set the course for the rest of his life and dogged him to the end of his days.</p></p><p>A.E. HOTCHNER is a life-long writer and the author of seventeen books, among them <i>O.J. in the Morning, G &amp; T at Night </i>and <i>Papa Hemingway, </i>a critically acclaimed 1966 memoir of his thirteen-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway. Hotchner's memoir, <i>King of the Hill,</i> was adapted into a film by Steven Soderbergh. In addition to his writing career, Hotchner is co-founder, along with Paul Newman, of <i>Newman's Own</i> foods. He lives in Connecticut with his wife and his indispensable parrot, Ernie.<p>"In this piercingly intimate new volume, A. E. Hotchner plumbs the depths of Hemingway's most poignant realizations and regrets - not just whom he loved and ultimately lost, but the very nature of his heart. A tender and devastating portrait...and one I will personally treasure." - Paula McLain, author of <i>The Paris Wife</i> </p><p>"The first complete understanding of the writer as a man...an important book."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)</p><p>"A portrait of triumphant highs, melancholic lows, and the pervading tone of the subject's generation&#x2015;a human being's love lost."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Hotchner tells an engaging and harrowing story...offers us something of a 'behind the scenes' glimpse at how Hemingway was processing his past, and dealing with the lingering trauma of regret, physical pain, and his deteriorating creative ability....The final years of Hemingway's life have never been told with such eloquence and compassion."&#x2015;<i>PopMatters </i></p><p>"Hotchner takes his reader into the beautiful Gritti Palace Hotel in Venice...paints Paris in the 1920s replete with Gertrude Stein, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Archibald MacLeish, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and others. ...<i>Hemingway in Love</i> is a lovely little amuse-gueule."&#x2015;<i>The Lincoln Star Journal</i> </p><p>"A.

Any particular style of playing which represents an authentic way of musical feeling is genuine expression. By virtue of its significance in place, time and circumstance, it possesses its own tradition, artistic standards and audience that keeps it alive. Hot jazz, therefore, is expression and communication, a musical and social manifestation, and Blue Note Records are concerned with identifying its impulse, not its sensational and commercial adornments."&#x2014;from a flyer for one of Blue Note&#x2019;s early releases, dated May, 1939. <p>--- </p><p>Blue Note Records is arguably the single most recognizable record label in the history of recorded music.

Born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 1914, he was educated at Slad village school and Stroud Central School. At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then travelled on foot through Spain, where he was trapped by the outbreak of the Civil War. He later returned by crossing the Pyrenees, as he recounted in A Moment of War. Laurie Lee published four collections of poems: The Sun My Monument (1944), The Bloom of Candles (1947), My Many-Coated Man (1955) and Pocket Poems (1960). His other works include The Voyage of Magellan (1948), The Firstborn (1964), I Can&#39;t Stay Long (1975), and Two Women (1983). He also wrote three bestselling volumes of autobiography: Cider with Rosie (1959), which has sold over six million copies worldwide, As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969) and A Moment of War (1991).Naivet&#x17d; and modern warfare meet in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. Young Lee arrives in Spain prepared for battle though not for the skepticism nor his imprisonment. Thorne's matter-of-fact, almost conversational recital captures young Lee's trusting enthusiasm. Events, both petty and horrendous, are made credible without emotional histrionics. The reader's quiet energy gives Lee's character unspoken wonder and fear. Thorne provides well-rendered characterizations and near-perfect multi-national accents. It's a curious, yet compelling, odyssey. S.B.S.

They remember the fox stopping a moment on dainty paws to sniff the stones. Or the doe stepping soundlessly through the bracken, her nose to the night air. Or in the wilderness darkness beyond, the unblinking yellow eyes of the wolf. And they hear the wind that breathes over the well, murmuring a name. </p><p>Ciaran.</p>Profiling the sixth-century Saint Ciaran of Saighir, first saint of Ireland, Schmidt (The Blessing of the Lord) piles on more information and ideas than his picture book can hold. On the one hand, the whole of Ciaran's life story, as presented here, appears to be ideal subject matter--from the falling star his mother seemingly swallows before his birth, to the bell Saint Patrick gives him in Rome (it will peal only when Ciaran reaches "the flowing spring of Saighir"), to his fellowship with wild animals. But the individual components of the story demand more attention than Schmidt allots. The phrasing itself raises questions: the boy Ciaran prays "to a God whose name had never been heard in Ireland" and "to the God whose name he did not know." Ciaran is somehow drawn to Rome, but Schmidt stops short of stating that he is answering a calling; readers may wonder how or why "Ciaran's eyes looked to the east." While the mixture of legend, history and faith follows Irish tradition, most readers will be hard pressed to make sense of it. The presentation, however, is quite handsome. Doney's (Red Bird) slightly hazy oil paintings depict a rugged green countryside of unspoiled beauty. His use of bright and dappled sunlight and cool shadow gives depth to the scenes here. All ages.

But he knew instinctively that if he opened his mouth to try and suck in a breath, he would die.<br><br>Gritting his teeth fiercely, Murphy opened his eyes instead. And a pair of yellow, animal eyes stared back. Then a wildly gaping jaw came into focus through the greenish gloom, pointed teeth bared in a silent snarl. Murphy reached out, expecting the teeth to clamp down on his hand, but the dog face had disappeared, sucked back into the watery darkness.<br><br>It was no good. He had to get some air into his lungs before they burst. He turned his face upward, toward the feeble light, and after an agonizing few seconds during which he had the horrifying sense that he was sinking, not rising, his head broke the surface.<br><br>He sucked in a huge, spluttering breath, simultaneously grabbing on to the narrow stone ledge that projected from the side of the pit. Resting his head against the jagged rock, he could feel something warm mingling with the freezing water. Blood. As the pain suddenly hit him, a wild carousel of thoughts started racing round his brain.<br><br>Laura. He would never see her again. She wouldn&#x2019;t even know he had died here, in this remote, godforsaken place. She would never know his last thoughts had been about her.<br><br>Then he remembered. Laura was dead. She&#x2019;d died in his arms. <br><br>And now he was about to join her. With that thought, his body seemed to relax, accepting its fate, and he felt himself slipping back into the surging torrent.<br><br>No! He couldn&#x2019;t give up. He couldn&#x2019;t let the crazy old man win at last. He had to find a way out.<br>But first he had to find those puppies. <br><br>Clutching the ledge with both hands, Murphy took a series of quick, deep breaths, hyperventilating to force as much oxygen as possible into his lungs. He&#x2019;d done enough cave diving to know he could stay under a full two minutes if he had to. But that was under ideal conditions. Right now he had to contend with the effects of shock, blood loss, and bone-shaking cold&#x2013;all the while trying to find two little dogs somewhere in a swirling maelstrom. As he let himself slip back under the freezing water, he wondered&#x2013;not for the first time&#x2013;how he managed to get himself into these messes.<br><br>The answer was simple. One word: Methuselah. <br><br>Murphy had been making his way carefully through the cave, fanning his flashlight across the dank black walls, when he found himself standing not on loose shale but what felt like solid wooden planks. Ever alert to tricks and traps, Murphy instinctively reacted as if he&#x2019;d just stepped onto a tray of burning coals&#x2013;but before he could leap aside, the trapdoor sprang open. As he felt himself plunging into the void, a familiar cackling laugh shattered the silence, echoing crazily off the rock walls. <br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to the game, Murphy! Get out of this one if you can!&#x201d;<br><br>As Murphy cartwheeled through space, his brain was still trying to come up with a suitable response. But all that came out was a grunt as he slammed into the ground like a bag of cement and the air was punched out of his lungs, before the impact flung him sideways and his head connected with a boulder. For a moment all was black, buzzing darkness. Then he raised himself up on his hands and knees and his senses returned one by one: He could feel the damp grit between his fingers; he could taste it in his mouth; he could smell stagnant water; he could dimly make out the shadowy walls of the pit he&#x2019;d fallen into.<br><br>And he could hear the fretful whining of what sounded like two cold, wet&#x2013;and very scared&#x2013;little dogs.<br>He turned toward the sound and there they were, shivering together on a narrow ledge. A pair of German shepherd puppies. Murphy shook his head: He always tried to prepare himself for anything where Methuselah was concerned, but what were a couple of puppies doing in the middle of an underground cave complex miles from anywhere? Could they have gotten lost and somehow wandered this far from the surface? He didn&#x2019;t think so. Much more likely they were there because Methuselah had put them there. <br><br>They were part of the game.<br><br>Fighting his natural instinct to gather the bedraggled pups tightly in his arms and tell them everything was going to be okay, he approached the ledge cautiously. They looked so helpless. But that didn&#x2019;t mean harmless. Nothing in Methuselah&#x2019;s games was harmless, and if he had put them there for Murphy to find, then something about the dogs was out of whack. He just had to figure out what.<br><br>Just then the steady dripping sound that had been nagging away at the back of Murphy&#x2019;s consciousness since he landed in the pit started to get louder. He turned in the direction of the noise and suddenly it became a roaring, as a huge wave of water surged through a narrow gap in the rocks. In a second a frothing tide was tugging at his ankles, pulling him off balance. Forgetting Methuselah&#x2019;s mind games, he pushed himself back toward the ledge, scooped up the puppies, and stuffed them under his jacket. His eyes darted round the walls of the pit, looking for anything that would help him find a way out, as the rising water swirled around his chest. The puppies were just a diversion, he thought bitterly, fighting to keep his footing. He hadn&#x2019;t spotted the real danger until it was too late. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, fellas, I&#x2019;ll get you out of here,&#x201d; he assured them with more confidence than he felt. Then the torrent lifted him off his feet and the panicking dogs squirmed out of his jacket. Fighting to keep his head above the surface, he grabbed for them, but his fingers closed on icy water and then he too was engulfed, spinning out of control like a bunch of wet clothes in a Laundromat washer.<br><br>He closed his eyes, and even as his lungs started hungrily demanding air, he tried to find a calm place in his mind where he could think. He checked through his options. The water would soon reach the level of the trapdoor, which was no doubt secured against escape. So, search for another way out under the water, or look for the puppies again before they drowned? If he tried to find a way out on his own, the puppies would be dead by the time he found it. If he tried to save the puppies first, he&#x2019;d probably wind up too exhausted to find a way out. If there was a way out.<br><br>So much for his options.<br><br>The only shred of hope he could cling to was the fact that this was a game. And a game, however deadly, still had rules. <br><br>But there was no way he could figure them out while his lungs were screaming and his thought processes were beginning to go fuzzy due to lack of oxygen.<br><br>Get some air. Then go after those puppies. If he was still alive after that, maybe God would give him some inspiration.<br><br>When Murphy walked into the lab, he was greeted by the sight of a young woman bent over a workbench, her jet-black hair, tied back in a ponytail, making a stark contrast with her crisp white lab coat as she scrutinized a sheet of parchment. She didn&#x2019;t look up as the door clicked shut behind him, and he stood for a moment, smiling at the expression of fierce concentration on her face.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you grinning at, Professor?&#x201d; she asked, her eyes never leaving the parchment.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing, Shari. Nothing at all. It&#x2019;s just nice to see someone so absorbed in their work, is all.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave a short &#x201c;hmph,&#x201d; still not looking up, and Murphy&#x2019;s smile broadened. Shari Nelson was one of the top students in his biblical archaeology class at Preston University, and for almost two years she had been his part-time research assistant. In that time he&#x2019;d come to appreciate her passion for the subject, her limitless capacity for hard work, and her sharp intelligence. But most of all, he valued her warm and generous spirit. She might be pretending to ignore him right now, but they&#x2019;d been through enough tragedy and heartache together in the past year, with the deaths of his wife and her brother still painful every hour of every day, for him to know that she would drop everything&#x2013;even a fascinating ancient parchment like the one she was studying&#x2013;if he needed her.<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s up, Shari? Did the results from the carbon-dating tests on our little pottery fragment come in?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Shari replied, returning the parchment to the clear plastic container on the bench. &#x201c;But something has definitely arrived for you.&#x201d; She gestured toward a large white envelope with the purple and orange lettering of Federal Express.<br><br>Shari watched eagerly as Murphy picked up the package. Clearly she&#x2019;d had a hard time containing her curiosity while she waited for Murphy to arrive at the lab. <br><br>&#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;No return address. Just Babylon. Doesn&#x2019;t look like it went through the usual FedEx mailing process.&#x201d; He heard Shari gasp. Babylon, she knew all too well, could only mean one thing: a whole heap of trouble. <br><br>Murphy carefully opened the envelope and shook the contents&#x2013;a smaller envelope with the words Professor Murphy printed in heavy marker and a xeroxed page from a map&#x2013;out onto the workbench. He glanced at the map, then opened the second envelope. Inside was an index card with three words typed on it.<br><br>Chemar. Zepheth. Kopher.<br><br>He handed it to Shari while he examined the map. A route had been marked in pink felt-tip from Raleigh, moving west, across the border into Tennessee. Where the snaking line stopped, there were an X and four barely legible words written in a spidery scrawl:<br><br>&#x201c;Cave of the Waters. Mean anything to you, Shari?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It sounds like somewhere you definitely don&#x2019;t want to go,&#x201d; she replied firmly.<br>He winced. Exactly what Laura would have said. Same tone of voice, even.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming back to me. I&#x2019;ve heard of this place. It&#x2019;s in the Great Smoky Mountains . . . past Asheville, somewhere between Waynesville and Bryson City.&#x201d; If he remembered it right, the cave was discovered in the early 1900s but had never been fully explored, because the high water table in the area&#x2013;not to mention at least three underground streams that ran through it&#x2013;caused the chambers to flood periodically. It was supposed to contain a vast labyrinth of passageways, but no one knew how far they extended. Caving expeditions had been officially discouraged after three cavers were lost without a trace in the early seventies.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, so we&#x2019;ve got directions to a cave. Now, what about the message on the card? What do you make of it, Shari?&#x201d;<br><br>She repeated the words. &#x201c;Chemar. Zepheth. Kopher. It&#x2019;s Hebrew. No problem there. But beyond that it&#x2019;s got me stumped. Does it have something to do with Babylon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me,&#x201d; he said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. &#x201c;But right now it doesn&#x2019;t mean any more to me than it does to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no signature anywhere, and no return address. So how can we find out who sent this?&#x201d;<br>Murphy gave a half-smile. &#x201c;Come on, Shari. A mysterious message in an ancient language? A set of directions to a remote spot? Babylon? He didn&#x2019;t really need to sign it, did he?&#x201d;<br><br>Shari sighed. &#x201c;I guess not. I was just hoping . . . you know, that it might be something else. Something innocent. Not one of these crazy games where you&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>She could tell Murphy wasn&#x2019;t listening anymore. He was studying the map intently, already halfway there. Her heart sank as she realized there was nothing she could do to stop him. <br><br>All she could do now was pray.</p><h2>Murder in Chelsea (A Gaslight Mystery)</h2><p>Sarah Brandt is shattered when she learns that a woman has inquired at Hope&#x2019;s Daughters Mission for Catherine, the abandoned child she has taken as her daughter.

Amy starts her quest at one of the finest small hotels in the French Alps-a hotel noted for skiing and its famous cooking lessons-in the town of Valmeri. <br><br> A few days into her trip, Amy is nearly swept away by an avalanche (started, some say, by low-American warplanes). Two of the hotel's guests, esteemed English publisher Adrian Venn and his much younger American wife, Kerry, were not as fortunate as Amy. Both lie comatose in a nearby hospital. Learning that French and English law dictate a very different division of money depending on where Adrian dies, Adrian's children-young, old, legitimate, and illegitimate-assemble in Valmeri to protect their interests should he not pull through. <br><br> Amy, already suspect as an American, finds that her nationality freezes the social climate as she steps in to assist the family. In her innocence, Amy sets in motion a series of events in France and England that spotlight ancient national differences, customs, and laws. Add one or two small affairs that may topple carefully balanced alliances, and soon it is as the French say, a situation. <br><br> Hailed as witty, delicious, nuanced and fresh by book critics across the country, Diane Johnson has composed her most amusing and insightful character to date in young Amy Hawkins.

It was a lifeless, featureless place, and yet the shapes of the fields were clear, marked out by the moonshadow of the dark oak hedges that bordered them. Distantly, from that shadow round the meadow called The Stumps, the ghostly figure began to move again, following a hidden track over the rise of ground, then moving left, into tree cover. It stood there, just visible now to the old man who watched it from Stretley Farm; watching back. The cloak it wore was dark, the hood pulled low over its face. As it moved for the second time, coming closer to the farmhouse, it left the black wood behind. It was stooped, against the Christmas cold, perhaps. Where it walked it left a deep furrow in the fresh snow. <br>Standing at the gate of the farm, waiting for the moment he knew, now, must surely come, Owen Keeton heard his grandchild begin to cry. He turned to the dark face of the house and listened. The sobbing was a brief disturbance; a dream perhaps. Then the infant girl was quiet again. <br>Keeton retraced his steps across the garden, stepped into the warm house and kicked the snow from his boots. He walked into the parlour, prodded the log fire with the metal poker until the flames roared again, then went to the window and peered out at the main road to Shadoxhurst, the nearest village to the farm. He could just hear, very distantly, the sound of carols. Glancing at the clock above the fire he realized that Christmas Day had begun ten minutes before. <br>At the parlour table he stared down at the book of folklore and legend that lay open there. The print was very fine, the pages thick and of good quality paper; the illustrations, in full colour, were exquisite. It was a book he loved, and he was giving it to his granddaughter as a present. The images of knights and heroes inspired him; the Welshness of the names and places made him nostalgic for the lost places and lost voices of his own youth in the mountains of Wales. The epic tales had filled his head with the sound of battle, war-cry, and the rustle of tree and bird in the glades of haunted forest. <br>Now there was something else in the book, written in the white spaces around the print: a letter. His letter to the child. <br>He turned back to the beginning of that letter, where the chapter on Arthur of the Britons began. He scanned the words quickly: <br>* * * <br> <i>My dear Tallis: I'm an old man writing to you on a cold December night. I wonder if you will love the snow as much as I do? And regret as much the way it can imprison you. There is old memory in snow. You will find that out in due course, for I know where you come from, now</i>&#x2026; <br>* * * <br>&nbsp; <br>The fire guttered and Keeton shivered despite it, and despite the heavy coat he wore. He stared at the wall, beyond which the snow-covered garden led to the fields, and that hooded figure, coming towards him. He felt a sudden urgent need to have done with this letter, to finalize it. It was a sort of panic. It gripped his heart and his stomach, and the hand that reached for the pen was shaking. The sound of the clock grew loud, but he resisted the urge to stare at it, to mark the passage of time, so little time, so few minutes&#x2026; <br>He had to finish writing the letter, and soon. He bent to the page and began to squeeze the words into the narrow margin: <br>* * * <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>We bring alive ghosts, Tallis, and the ghosts huddle at the edge of vision. They are wise in ways that are a wisdom we all still share but have forgotten. But the wood is us and we are the wood! You will learn this. You will learn names. You will smell that ancient winter, so much more ferocious than this simple Xmas snow. And as you do so, you are treading an old and important pathway. I began to tread it first, until they abandoned me</i>&#x2026; <br>* * * <br>He wrote on, turning the pages, filling the margins, linking his own words to the unconscious child with the words of fable, forming a link that would be of value to her, one day in her future. <br>When he had finished the letter he used his handkerchief to blot the ink then closed the book. He wrapped it in heavy brown paper and tied it with a length of string. <br>On the brown paper he wrote this simple message: <i>For Tallis; for your fifth birthday. From Granddad Owen</i>. <br>He buttoned up his coat again and went back out into the cold, silent winter's night. He stood outside the door for a moment feeling frightened, very disturbed. The hooded figure had come all the way across the fields and was standing by the gate to the garden, watching the house. Keeton hesitated a moment longer, then trudged over to it. <br>Only the gate separated them. Keeton was shivering inside his heavy overcoat, but his body burned with heat. The hood was low over the woman's head and he could not tell which of the three she was. She must have been aware of his unspoken thought since she looked up slightly, turning to regard him. As she did so, Keeton realized she had been staring past him. A white mask gleamed from below the woollen cape. <br>"It's you, then&#x2026;" Keeton whispered. <br>Distantly, moving down the slope from the earthworks on Barrow Hill, he saw two other hooded figures. As if aware that he had noticed them, they stopped and seemed to shrink into the whiteness of the land. <br>He said, almost bitterly, "I was beginning to understand. I had begun to understand. And now you're abandoning me&#x2026;" <br>In the house, the child cried out. White Mask glanced towards the landing window, but the cry was another transient moment of disturbance. Keeton watched the ghost woman and couldn't help the tears that surfaced to sting his eyes. She looked back at him and he thought he saw some hint of her face through the thin holes that were the eyes. <br>"Listen to me," he said softly. "I have something to ask you. You see, they've lost their son. He was shot down over Belgium. They've lost him and they'll grieve for years. If you take the daughter, now&#x2026;if you take her now&#x2026;" he shuddered, wiped a hand across his eyes and took a deep breath of the frozen air. White Mask watched him without movement, without sound. "Give them a few years. Please? If you don't want me&#x2026;at least give them a few years with the child&#x2026;" <br>White Mask slowly raised a finger to the lips of the chalk-smeared wood which covered her face. Keeton could see how old that finger was, how loose the skin on the hand, how small the hand. <br>Then she turned and ran from him, her dark cloak billowing, feet kicking up the snow. Halfway across the field she stopped and turned. Keeton heard the shrill sound of her laughter. This time, as she ran, it was away to the west, towards the shadow wood, Ryhope Wood. On Barrow Hill her companions were running too. <br>Keeton knew the country well. He could see at once that the three figures would meet at the edge of Stretley Stones meadow, where five ogham stones marked ancient graves. <br>He was both relieved and intrigued, relieved because White Mask had agreed with his request; he was certain of it. They would not come for Tallis, not for many years. He was certain of it. <br>And he was intrigued by the Stretley Stones, and by the ghost women who were moving to rendezvous there. <br> <i>The child would be safe</i>&#x2026; <br>He glanced round, guiltily. The house was in silence. <br> <i>The child would be safe for a few minutes&#x2026;just a few minutes&#x2026;he would be back at the house long before Tallis's parents returned from the Christmas service</i>. <br>Stretley Stones beckoned him. He pulled his coat more tightly around him, opened the gate, and waded out into the deep snow of the field. He followed White Mask's tracks, and soon he was running to see what they would do in the meadow where the marked stones lay&#x2026; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 1988 by Robert Holdstock</p><h2>Creole Religions of the Caribbean: An Introduction from Vodou and Santeria to Obeah and Espiritismo (Religion, Race, and Ethnicity, 3)</h2><p><p>Creolization&#x2014;the coming together of diverse beliefs and practices to form new beliefs and practices-is one of the most significant phenomena in Caribbean religious history.

Tour.</p><p>Coogan ( The Man Who Made Ireland: The Life and Death of Michael Collins ) here presents a definitive history of an organization that has been equally romanticized and vilified. Considered by many to be the legitimate successor of the Fenians, the Irish Republican Army was founded during the war of independence (1916-1922). After the treaty signing, the leadership split over its ratification, dividing the IRA into Collins's pro-treaty side and Eamon de Valera's anti-treaty forces. Coogan relates the IRA's support of de Valera and his subsequent about-face on becoming Taoiseach (Prime Minister) when he introduced the Offences Against the State Act in 1939 in response to the IRA's bombing campaign in England. Some of the most interesting parts of this book surround the events of WW II when de Valera coyly played his neutrality card in favor of the British. Coogan reminds us that the present troubles in Northern Ireland began as a civil rights campaign and did not take on a truly militant character until the events of the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972, in which 13 unarmed marchers were killed, reviving a comatose IRA. The author relates atrocities on both sides as the IRA fought with arms, hunger strikes and funeral processions, while the British countered with prisons, torture and assassination squads. This first U.S. edition (the book was originally published in the U.K. in 1970) is updated with important information concerning the Special Air Services, a British hit-unit and the story of "Maxwell," an Ulster Defense Regiment officer whose mission included the destruction of the Book of Kells. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them</h2><p>Susan Forward is a therapist, author, and talk-show host whose specialty is abusive relationships. This book grew out of her realization that her own marriage as well as those of many of her clients followed a pattern. Many men need to control their relationships completely and consequently are mentally (if not physically) abusive. They denigrate their partners, resent them if they have any outside interests, and become furious for trivial reasons. Women with low self-esteem are drawn to these men because they can also be charming and devoted. Forward devotes the first half of the book to an analysis of the problem, the second half to breaking the pattern and getting outside help.

Her first book,<i> Poetics of Place</i>, has been widely praised for its aesthetic and technical accomplishments.<br>*Starred Review* Geesaman's<i> Poetics of Place</i> (1999) contains some of the finest formal-garden photography ever published--in monochrome, no less, which she developed into vibrant, velvety visions of the ideal garden. She carries over the elements of composition and development that made those images so astonishing into <i>Gardenscapes</i>, but now she is shooting in color, and that has, she says, brought a crucial element of discovery into her work. She experiments with degrees of coloration in the darkroom, striving to find hues obscured by the predominant color (usually, in these pictures, green) that will help the print achieve "a painterly quality because all the color relationships are right." Mission accomplished in these ravishing pictures, which by turns call to mind Friedrich, Monet, Sargent, and, many times, Redon and Pollock. That is, their artistic manners range from mysticism to abstract expressionism. If in general they recall gauzy early-twentieth-century pictorialist photography, they lack its sentimentality by eschewing human figures, other than sculpture, and appealing thereby to the taste for austerity. But their austerity is, because of all the flowers, leaves, bark, and branches, the sensuous austerity that is one kind of timeless beauty. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I disconnected my heart and intellect in an act of self-defense, despair, and hopelessness." With these words Sara Nomberg-Przytyk begins this painful and compelling account of her experiences while imprisoned for two years in the infamous death camp. Writing twenty years after her liberation, she recreates the events of a dark past which, in her own words, would have driven her mad had she tried to relive it sooner. But while she records unimaginable atrocities, she also richly describes the human compassion that stubbornly survived despite the backdrop of camp depersonalization and imminent extermination.<br><br>Commemorative in spirit and artistic in form, <i>Auschwitz</i> convincingly portrays the paradoxes of human nature in extreme circumstances. With consummate understatement Nomberg-Przytyk describes the behavior of concentration camp inmates as she relentlessly and pitilessly examines her own motives and feelings. In this world unmitigated cruelty coexisted with nobility, rapacity with self-sacrifice, indifference with selfless compassion. This book offers a chilling view of the human drama that existed in Auschwitz.<br><br>From her portraits of camp personalities, an extraordinary and horrifying profile emerges of Dr. Josef Mengele, whose medical experiments resulted in the slaughter of nearly half a million Jews. Nomberg-Przytyk's job as an attendant in Mengle's hospital allowed her to observe this Angel of Death firsthand and to provide us with the most complete description to date of his monstrous activities.<br><br>The original Polish manuscript was discovered by Eli Pfefferkorn in 1980 in the Yad Vashem Archive in Jerusalem.

Born in 1935, in the city of Bath, Mary&#39;s childhood was a curious mix of idyllic picnics and ramblings, and alarming air raids; of a spirited and outdoorsy home life and a dreaded school existence. All nearly cut horribly short by an almost fatal bout of polio when she was thirteen, which isolated Mary in hospital, away from beloved family and friends for months. Recovery saw her turn to her one true passion - cookery. And so began a love affair that has - so far - spanned six remarkable decades; from demonstrating ovens in the early 1950s to producing glossy food magazines in the 60s and 70s, gradually becoming the country&#39;s most prolific and - many would say - best loved cookery writer. Until her emergence in the 21st century as a TV sensation and style icon on the Great British Bake Off. As a working mother, at the heart of a busy household, Mary became an expert at the art of juggling, even bringing her working life into her home with her Aga school. And there have been challenges, one terrible tragedy and many joys along the way. In this touching, evocative and fascinating memoir, we accompany Mary on her journey of nearly eighty years; a life lived to the full, with a wicked sense of fun and an eye for the absurd, it is the life of a delightfully traditional but thoroughly modern woman. Fans of The Great British Bake Off can&#39;t wait to get their hands on Mary Berry&#39;s Recipe for Life. Born in 1935, Mary has been teaching Britain how to cook for over half a century. Her far-reaching culinary career has taken her from recipe tester, cookery editor, author and entrepreneur to TV personality. Mary lives in Buckinghamshire with her husband Paul.</p><p>Mary Berry has been teaching the nation how to cook for sixty years.

Milne&#39;s Now We Are Six in a second collection of hilarious reworkings of Milne&#39;s classic verses.</p><p>When Christopher Matthew was six, the poems of A.A. Milne were always on hand to reassure him that other children were just as puzzled and naughty and foolish as he was &#x2039; and that grown-ups could be even sillier. Now that he is sixty, he has decided it�s high time there was an equally reassuring volume for those of his generation who are not only more confused than ever, but are losing their teeth, their hair and, all too often, their car keys. What he has done is take some of Milne�s best-loved poems and rewritten them for sixty-year-olds, with results that are often hilarious, sometimes rueful, and always thought-provoking. The poems not only follow the familiar rhythms and rhyme schemes of the master, but reinvent that curious mixture of comedy and wistfulness, sharp observation and daft whimsy that has delighted children and adults for over seventy years.Apart from Now We Are Sixty, Christopher Matthew, is best known for his Diary of a Somebody and its accident-prone hero Simon Crisp, whom Sheridan Morley called &#39;one of the greatest comic characters of our time&#39;. He has been a columnist for most of the major newspapers, currently writes on books and TV for the Daily Mail, and is well known as a broadcaster. He lives in London and Suffolk.</p><h2>DK Science Encyclopedia (Revised Edition)</h2><p>Thoroughly updated to cover new technological advances from the Internet to the Mars expedition, a profusely illustrated, colorful encyclopedia explains more than two thousand scientific subjects in a lively way geared to children.</p><p>This encyclopedia can make anyone feel like a scientist! Not only does it have fascinating facts on everything from atoms to zephyrs, it also shows how scientists work--describing, measuring, and asking questions about the world. Filled with detailed, sharp illustrations and eye-catching photographs, this book could keep a curious kid (or adult!) occupied for weeks. The one- and two-page entries are thematically organized--much more useful than alphabetical entries for making connections and thinking about whole systems. Some of the best categories are "Reactions," "Materials," "Weather," "Space," and "How Living Things Work." But <i>every</i> entry has accurate, well-written text cross-indexed to related pages and to the "Fact Finder" section in the back, with charts, tables, and maps to use with each section. A glossary and index round out this thorough package. You may grow so attached to this fantastic encyclopedia that you never want to leave it behind.... For portability, we recommend the pocket version, which weighs less, but is jam-packed with great science. And for budding biologists who can't get enough of the "Living Things" section in the <i>Science Encyclopedia</i>, the <i>The DK Nature Encyclopedia</i> is sure to please. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Grade 4-8?A revision of the 1993 edition with minor changes and additions, this volume differs from its nearest competitor, The Kingfisher Science Encyclopedia (1993) chiefly in its basic organization; rather than an alphabetical arrangement, the 280 entries are grouped into 12 topical sections ("Weather," "Ecology," "Reactions," etc.). Each one-to-two page article is drizzled with small, clipped color photos and paintings supplemented by boxed capsule biographies, brief side excursions, and see-also references. The book concludes with a relatively dense "Fact Finder Section" into which are gathered charts, statistics, and specialized terms. Updating has been done with such a light hand that there is still no mention of flat-screen TV, the World Wide Web, cloned mammals, or the Mars Pathfinder expedition. Still, for its emphasis on the interconnectedness of science and technology, this title has a place in collections. Consider it as a fresh replacement copy rather than a new work.?John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod</h2><p>Winterdance is an unforgettable account of Gary Paulsen&#39;s most ambitious quest: to know a world beyond his knowing, to train for and run the Iditarod. Fueled by an all-consuming passion for running dogs, Paulsen entered the grueling 1,180-mile race across Alaska in dangerous ignorance and with fierce determination. For seventeen days, Paulsen and his team of fifteen dogs ran through breathtaking and treacherous Arctic terrain. They crossed the barren, moonlike landscape of the Alaskan interior and witnessed sunrises that cast a golden blaze over the vast waters of the Bering Sea. They endured blinding wind, snowstorms, frostbite, dogfights, moose attacks, sleeplessness, hallucinations - and the relentless push to go on. He crossed the finish line, but it wasn&#39;t enough: Paulsen was obsessed and wanted to race again. Though the dangers of the Iditarod were legion, more frightening still was the knowledge that he could not stop racing dogs of his own free will.</p><p>Fueled by a passion for running dogs, Gary Paulsen entered the Iditarod--the 1150-mile winter sled-dog race between Anchorage and Nome-- in dangerous ignorance and with a fierce determination. <b>Winterdance</b> is his account of this seventeen-day battle against Nature's worst elements and his own frailty.Gary Paulsen is an American writer, perhaps best known for coming of age stories about nature and the wilderness.

He won the MARGARET EDWARDS AWARD from the American Library Association in 1997.</p><h2>Messianic Christology</h2><p>Messianic Christology is a study of Old Testament prophecy concerning the First Coming of the Messiah. Dr. Fruchtenbaum works his way through the Old Testament following the first century Jewish arrangement of the books, the arrangement that Jesus was familiar with. He shows from The Law, The Prophets and The Writings... how the revelation of the Messiah gradually progressed and built-up to reveal a magnificent picture of the Deliverer to come.<br><br>The Hebrew Scriptures formed the very basis for evangelism in the New Testament. First, Jesus with His disciples, and then the disciples themselves used the Old Testament to substantiate His claim to be the Messiah. When the messianic expectations of Hebrew prophecy are fully understood, it becomes clear that Jesus and only Jesus can fulfill these requirements.</p><p>Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum was Born September 26, 1943 in Russia, after his father was released from a Communist prison. Even though he is Jewish, his father was accused of being a Nazi spy when he fled Poland from Hitler. The Fruchtenbaums escaped from behind the Iron Curtain with help from the Israeli underground. They resided in Germany from 1946 to 1951, where Arnold received orthodox Jewish training. The Fruchtenbaums immigrated to Brooklyn in 1951, where they first came in contact with the American Board of Missions to the Jews (now Chosen People Ministries). At age 13, Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum became a believer in the Messiahship of Jesus. Arnold&#39;s father strongly opposed his beliefs, however; he allowed Arnold to continue associating with and learning from other Jewish believers until the family moved to Los Angeles in 1958. Once in Los Angeles, Arnold was forbidden to read the Bible, attend Christian meetings, or have anything to do with Messianic Jewish groups. Arnold, however; continued to maintain contact with Jewish believers and to walk with the Lord as best he could. Upon his graduation from High School, he was informed by his father that he would have to leave home because of his beliefs. In 1962, Arnold began undergraduate education at Shelton College. In 1966 He transferred to and graduated from Cedarville University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Hebrew and Greek. He moved to Israel that July, and studied archaeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew at the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and at the Hebrew University. In September 1967, Arnold enrolled at Dallas Theological Seminary. He also began working as a missionary with the American Board of Missions to the Jews. He graduated in 1971 with a Master of Theology degree. In June 1968, he married Mary Ann Morrow. In 1971, they moved to Israel, settling in Jerusalem. They worked with the local messianic congregation training young Israeli believers for service. His activities for Messiah drew the anger of the religious authorities in Jerusalem, finally forcing them to leave Israel in 1973. For the next two years he was a minister for the American Board of Missions to the Jews, and editor of The Chosen People. In 1976, he joined the staff of The Christian Jew Foundation as Associate Director of the largest Messianic Jewish broadcasting ministry in the world. In the summer of 1976, Arnold, along with others in Jewish missions, discussed the lack of discipleship and intensive biblical and theological training of Jewish believers. The early concepts of Ariel Ministries were born at that time. In December 1977 Ariel Ministries became a reality based on the principles of evangelism and discipleship. Arnold now serves as the director of the ministry. In 1989, Arnold completed his Ph.D. at New York University. He is the author of several books and has contributed articles in a number of books and journals. Frequently in demand as a conference speaker and teacher, he has traveled throughout Europe, Asia, Israel, and the United States, becoming intimately acquainted with the Messianic Jewish movement.</p><h2>How to Build Your Dream Cabin in the Woods: The Ultimate Guide to Building and Maintaining a Backcountry Getaway</h2><p><p><strong>Whether you want a fishing cabin or a &#x201c;green&#x201d; country life, J.

She couldn't get Morey's eyes to close all the way, and with them open only a slit, he looked sinister. It was the first thing that had frightened Lily in a very long time. She wouldn't look at them as she pushed back the darkened silver hair the rain had plastered to his skull. </p><p> One of her fingers slipped into a hole on the side of his head and she froze.

He was born in New York City, into a Jewish family that had immigrated from Russia, and received an A.B. from Columbia University. He was first a radio scriptwriter, and worked with Fred Allen, then in 1941 worked for the US government on radio spots selling war bonds. Wouk then joined the United States Navy and served in the Pacific Theater, an experience he later characterized as educational; &#34;I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans.&#34; His first ship was the USS Zane, then he was second-in-command on the Southard. He started his writing career onboard, working on a novel during his off-duty hours. He married Betty Sarah Brown in 1945, with whom he had three sons, became a fulltime writer in 1946, and published his debut novel, Aurora Dawn in 1947. In 1952, The Caine Mutiny received the Pulitzer Prize. In 1998, he received the Guardian of Zion Award.Narrator Jonathan Davis turns mere pages into a living story by giving a distinct voice to each character. His females don't speak in falsetto, but vary from whining to seductive. A lady scientist, Wen Lu, has a horrible Chinese accent, but listeners will know her when she talks. The novel rises from the hole remaining after the 1993 Congress killed the expensive nuclear collider being built in Texas to find a nuclear particle. When the Chinese discover the particle first, military minds and the American press awaken in panic. Davis's performance adds realism to a story in which hormonal urges, jealousy, and national pride energize the never-ending race to have the world's biggest bomb.

These two great sensory pleasures come together in the sumptuously illustrated <i>Food in Painting</i>. Here Kenneth Bendiner journeys from the Renaissance to the present day&#x2014;through the works of artists from Rembrandt to Manet to Warhol&#x2014;to make the case that, though understudied, paintings of food are so important that they should be considered a separate classification of art, a genre unto themselves. <br><br>Bendiner outlines the history of these paintings, charting changes in both meaning and presentation since the early Renaissance. The sixteenth century saw great innovations in food subjects, but, as Bendiner reveals, it was Dutch food painting of the seventeenth century that created the visual vocabulary still operative today. Alongside paintings that feature food as the central subject, he also considers topics ranging from Renaissance menus to aphrodisiacs to bottled water to the portrayal of dogs at the table&#x2014;always with an eye towards how the meaning of food imagery is determined by such factors as myth, religion, and social privilege. Bendiner also treats purely symbolic portrayals of food, both as marginal elements in allegorical paintings and as multi-layered sexual references in Surrealist works. <br><br>Packed full of images of markets, kitchens, pantries, picnics, and tables groaning under the weight of glorious feasts, <i>Food in Painting</i> serves up a delicious helping of luxuriously painted meals certain to win a spot on the shelves of art lovers and gastronomes alike. <br></p><p>Kenneth Bendiner is Professor of Art History at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and is the author of An Introduction to Victorian Painting (1985) and The Art of Ford Madox Brown (1998)."<i>Food in Painting</i> loads its table with good things to see. The analysis is shrewd; the commentaries incisive; the illustrations . . . suitably mouth-watering. From still-life to Surrealism, Bendiner shows the variety of symbolic flavours in food-themed art. However, unlike many art historians, he's not so blinded by symbolism that he fails to savour all the evidence about changes in diet, cooking and taste. A visual and mental feast." (<i>The Independent</i> 2005-02-04)<br><br>"This is not a traditional art historical study; rather, Bendiner's approach represents what many students and museumgoers seem to crave today: creative connections and nonlinear thinking, more in tune with the relatively new field of visual culture in which chronology is sublimated to ideas.&nbsp;. . . Refreshing and pleasurable to read. . .&nbsp; .An intriguing and provocative study. Reading Bendiner's book leaves one with the general tools to consider images of food in Western art form the Renasissance to the present in relation to one another, resulting in a rewarding game for the reader/viewer and a refreshing contribution to the field of art history."

When his influential patron asks for his help in a politically-sensitive murder case, Libertus is in no position to refuse. When the main suspect is also found murdered, the truth seems elusive.</p><p>Rosemary Rowe is the pseudonym of an author who has successfully published novels in another genre. Born in Cornwall, she lived for twenty years in New Zealand. A highly qualified academic, she has written more than a dozen best-selling text-books as Rosemary Aitken.If you like your murder trussed in a toga, you'll enjoy this mystery set in second-century Roman Britain. Ric Jerrom's upper-class British accent is well suited to the ruminations and perambulations of Libertus, a freedman and mosaicist of some repute and the Sherlock Holmes of his day. Jerrom's phrasing and tone are serious and measured without being slow or ponderous, capturing the indolence of patrician life. Libertus carefully navigates Rowe's labyrinth of murder, coming upon more than one poisoned corpse and a victim whose throat has been efficiently slit with a nocavula. Occasionally Jerrom's tempo is too fast, although his dialogues between two speakers are always easy to follow, each voice specifically defined. Jerrom skillfully presents the emotion conveyed by Rowe; however, on occasion, a hint of an Irish brogue is used to differentiate between suspects of the patrician class and the slave class.

Simultaneous.</p><p>CYNTHIA RYLANT is the acclaimed author of many beloved books for young people, including the Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby series, the novel Missing May, which received the Newbery Medal, and the Little Whistle series. She lives on an island in Puget Sound, Washington. ARTHUR HOWARD is best known as the illustrator of Cynthia Rylant's Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby series. He is also the illustrator of Kathi Appelt's Bubba and Beau series and has written and illustrated three picture books of his own: Hoodwinked; When I Was Five, an ABA's Pick of the Lists and a Crayola Kids Best Book; and Cosmo Zooms, an IRA-CBC Children's Choice. He lives in New York City.Ages 3-6. Rylant's simple sentences pair with endearing watercolors in this new entry in the Poppleton Pig series. This time, the stories are about sharing. Poppleton likes going to the movies by himself (he doesn't have to share his snacks), until he realizes he also doesn't have anyone to clutch during the movie's scary parts or laugh and cry with as the plot progresses. After the movie, he takes his leftover snacks to Cherry Sue's house, where he shares the popcorn and the film's highlights. In the second chapter, Poppleton and three friends make a quilt, which they decide to share, each one keeping it for one season of the year. The final chapter finds Poppleton wanting to soak in a hot bath, but going out with Cherry Sue instead. From the sight of the portly Poppleton trying to balance an oversize bucket of popcorn on his belly, to a view of him in the bath with a toy tugboat, the fanciful illustrations enhance the fun of this book for new readers. --E<i>llen Mandel</i> <i>Ellen Mandel</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With a long list of awards including three back-to-back Golden Globes and three consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series, <i>Mad Men</i> has captivated the world with its brilliant portrayal of the 1960s and stylish characters, including the dashing advertising mogul Roger Sterling. Directing and discovering some of the sharpest talents in the business, Roger has shown an uncanny flair for unique methods of motivation and a tireless genius, resulting in campaigns that raise the advertising standard across the country, and acquiring a reputation for his quips, barbs, and witticisms along the way. Presented as Roger&#x2019;s memoir during the fourth season of <i>Mad Men</i>, and published as a lost classic,&#x201d; <i>Sterling&#x2019;s Gold</i> is the entertaining collection of our favorite ad man&#x2019;s best one-liners.<br><br>Roger Sterling&#x2019;s pithy comments and observations amount to a unique window into the advertising world a world that few among us are privileged to witness firsthand as well as a commentary on life in New York City in the middle of the twentieth century. Cleverly designed and accented by design elements and attractive color photographs, and encased in an elegant, compact period package, it&#x2019;s a must-have for any <i>Mad Men</i> fan.</p><p>Roger Sterling is a Partner at the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce advertising agency; his father founded the original Sterling Cooper in the 1920s with Bertram Cooper.

When the new managers leave him off a corporate organizational chart, however, Roger believes he&#x2019;s "being punished for making my job look easy." He feels similarly slighted by friends who can&#x2019;t accept his relationship with Jane. "I made a mistake by being conspicuously happy," he tells Don.<br>Roger Sterling, the hard-drinking, silver-haired ad man portrayed by John Slattery on AMC&#x2019;s hit TV show Mad Men, is a straight-faced scene stealer who gets many of the best lines. (&#x201c;She died like she lived&#x2014;surrounded by the people she answered phones for.&#x201d;) And the idea of a real-life book based on the character&#x2019;s memoir seems promising: if someone well versed in the show&#x2019;s bible fleshed out some life stories for the self-aggrandizing Sterling, it could be worth reading, right? Alas, no. Despite the handsome, retro book design, this tie-in is a cynical cash-in, with one quote on each of its 171 pages, minus the ones with pictures or section headings. Some of the lines are, indeed, gold (the &#x201c;wit&#x201d; promised in the subtitle), but some are merely unmemorable lines of dialogue (surely &#x201c;Big talent attracts big clients&#x201d; can&#x2019;t be &#x201c;wisdom&#x201d;). Even the good lines suffer from lack of context because Sterling works best in counterpoint, not as a solo act. Instead of an inspired character riff, what we get here could have been done by an intern with a stack of scripts and a yellow highlighter&#x2014;perhaps that&#x2019;s where the &#x201c;gold&#x201d; comes in.

Now, in her most timely and intricate adventure yet, she must step in when hippies, yuppies and crackers clash with murderous consequences.<p>Overnight, it seems, Callahan's Atlanta neighborhood is morphing from a genial mix of hobo and boho into an upscale, cappuccino-drenched quarter. The most unsettling portent of this change is that YoYos, a venerable headshop, is being forced out of business so that a microbrewery can take over its prime location. As the neighborhood gears up for its raucous Halloween revels, Callahan realizes that trouble is brewing. Not only is a fierce tornado bearing down on Atlanta, but Wuvvy, the aging flower child who runs YoYos, is on an uncharacteristic rampage. And in the storm's aftermath, Callahan's fears are confirmed when she finds the bludgeoned corpse of the grasping young entrepreneur who was pushing Wuvvy out.</p><p>The police are quick to pin the crime on Wuvvy, but Callahan can't believe that this gentle soul would commit such a brutal act. Callahan's unique ability to mingle both with superannuated hippies and small-town Southern belles allows her to dig into the victim's past and Wuvvy's. She unearths a slew of succulent revelations about Wuvvy -- a tabloid-worthy tale strikingly at odds with the woman Callahan thought she knew. Her search also forces her to reassess old friendships in light of deadly new developments.</p><p>As Callahan's investigation unfolds, she unleashes her wry wit, tussles with the outrageous band of "girls" (and one newly recruited "boy") in her cleaning business and rekindles romance with her rugged beau, Mac McAuliffe. All in all, <em>Strange Brew</em> is superbly intoxicating suspense.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kathy Hogan Trocheck</strong> is the author of ten critically acclaimed mysteries, including the Callahan Garrity mystery series.

Edward Lewis brings the characters to life as he tirelessly reads of the actions and horrors of war and their effect on men far from home. As the story progresses, Lewis&#39;s presence disappears from the narration, and the listener is drawn toward the bloody war, the Bannons, their companions in war, and their families. Coyle&#39;s words and Lewis&#39;s narration make the bitter battles around Richmond at the end of the Civil War come alive. M.B.K. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThe concluding work in Coyle's splendid two-volume series on America's Civil War. Look Away (1995) followed the star-crossed Bannon brothers, James (a gentleman ranker in Virginia's Stonewall Brigade) and Kevin (a captain with the 4th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry), from their troubled but privileged youth in the Garden State through a brief face-to-face encounter at Gettysburg. The narrative at hand (which provides background enough to stand alone) picks up the parallel stories of James and Kevin after Gettysburg and tracks them through the endgame of a horrific conflict that proves more an endurance contest than a noble cause. Although James and Kevin never meet again on a battlefield, they are unwitting antagonists in many of the Eastern Theater's bloodiest campaigns. Among other near-miss collisions, James marches with the ragtag forces assembled by Jubal Early to menace Washington in mid-1864, while Kevin, still weak from wounds, commands a motley company of convalescents and Army clerks hastily armed to defend the seat of federal government. In their few respites from close-quarters combat, the brothers take comfort in two fine women, Kevin with Harriet Shields (a headstrong lass who, against her family's wishes, has gone south to nurse Union casualties) and James with Mary Beth McPherson (sister of a slain comrade). The fortunes of war throw Harriet and Mary Beth together when the latter's homestead is requisitioned as a front-line aid station in the wake of a Yankee rout of rebel troops near Winchester, Va. They soon part, and hostilities grind on until the North captures the Confederate capital of Richmond, where Mary Beth has gone to work in a munitions factory. Shortly thereafter, James (hopeful that the nation's suffering can now lead to national reconciliation) lays down his arms at Appomattox and heads North with Mary Beth, whom he's married, for a bittersweet reunion with Kevin and Harriet. A haunting, human-scale account of a cruel war. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

An invisible may have entered mainland Britain. An 'invisible' &amp;ndash, a terrorist who is an ethnic native of the target country, who can cross its borders unc</p><p>The woman who formerly headed Britain's intelligence service (and what would Ian Fleming have made of that?) comes in from the cold with a smart, clever, and brilliantly paced thriller that seems ripped from the headlines--if not today's, then probably tomorrow's. Liz Carlyle is an agent-runner in MI-5's Joint Counter-Terrorist Group, which is facing the ultimate intelligence nightmare; an "invisible," a terrorist who's an ethnic native of the target country and thus able to cross its borders unchecked and move around its environs unquestioned. All Liz and her team have to go on is the suspicion that a local fisherman who was shot with an unusual armor-piercing gun known to be favored by foreign agents and whose body was found in the restroom of a transport caf� near a smuggler's beach may have been involved in helping an undercover operative known as "Vengeance Before God" enter England without benefit of passport or visa--a man whose mission, if not his identity, has been the subject of recent intelligence "chatter" from militant Muslim sources. And while Liz thinks she knows who the operative is--an Afghani with forged papers last seen in a German port city--she doesn't have a clue about the "invisible" who's helping him, or the target in their crosshairs.<p> This is a tightly drawn, expertly told tale that wastes few words in describing the shadowy world of the intelligence services, the turf battles and infighting, and even the romantic entanglements that attend the lives of those involved. It marks a promising second career for its author, whose future success will doubtless be much more public than her earlier accomplishments. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>An announcement is made at a meeting of the British Intelligence Joint Counter-Terrorist group: &#x201c;The opposition may be about to deploy an invisible.&#x201d; An &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; is CIA-speak for the ultimate intelligence nightmare: a terrorist who is an ethnic native of the target country and who can therefore cross its borders unchecked, move around the country unquestioned, and go unnoticed while setting up the foundation for monstrous harm. <br><br>Intelligence officer Liz Carlyle has had to prove herself in countless ways as she&#x2019;s come up through the ranks of the traditionally all-male world of Britain&#x2019;s Security Service, MI5. But this announcement marks the start of an operation that will test all her hard-won knowledge and experience&#x2013;and her intelligence and courage&#x2013;as nothing has before. Having analyzed information from her agents, she realizes that there is indeed an imminent terrorist threat. She may even have the invisible&#x2019;s point of entry. But what she cannot draw out of all the &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; is the invisible&#x2019;s identity and intended target. <br><br>With each passing hour, the danger increases. As the desperate hunt continues, it becomes clear that Liz&#x2019;s intuitive skills, her ability to get deep inside her enemy&#x2019;s head, are her best hope for tracking down the terrorist. But will that be enough? And can she succeed in time to avert a disaster?<br><br>Drawing from her experience as the first woman director general of MI5, Stella Rimington gives us a story that is smart, tautly drawn, and suspenseful from first to last. <i>At Risk</i> is a stunning debut novel that plunges us headlong into today&#x2019;s shadowy and fever-pitched battle between terrorism and Intelligence.</p><h2>Bulbs: The Bulbous Plants of Europe and Their Allies</h2><p>Book by Grey-Wilson, Christopher, etc.</p><p></p><h2>Escape Velocity: A Charles Portis Miscellany</h2><p>For those who care about literature or simply love a good laugh (or both), Charles Portis has long been one of America's most admired novelists.

The collection encompasses the breadth of his fifty-year writing career, from his gripping reportage of the civil rights movement for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> to a comic short story about the demise of journalism in the 21st century. New to even the most ardent fan is his three-act play, <i>Delray's New Moon</i>, performed onstage in 1996 and published here for the first time.<br><br>Whether this is your first encounter with the world of Portis or a long-awaited return to it, you'll agree with critic Ron Rosenbaum--whose essay appears here alongside tributes by other writers--that Portis "will come to be regarded as the author of classics on the order of a twentieth-century Mark Twain, a writer who captures the soul of America."</p><p>PRAISE FOR CHARLES PORTIS<br>"Mr. Portis is a soft-spoken American genius and his work breathes pure decency. They ought to name a hotel after him, or at least a bus station." -Garrison Keillor<br> "Charles Portis is the goods: a deadpan reporter of human folly, a master of pathos, a compassionate portrayer of life's absolute absurdity, and a man with a voice." -Katherine A. Powers, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br> "No living Southern writer captures the spoken idioms of the South as artfully as Portis does." -Donna Tartt<br> "His fiction is the funniest I know, but the last thing in the world his characters have in mind is putting themselves across as comical. They are taking on the world in earnest. ... Lesser comic writers drag their characters onstage and say, 'Get a load of this guy!' Portis's characters just show up." -Roy Blount Jr.Charles Portis was born and raised in south Arkansas, graduating from Hamburg High School. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War, earned a journalism degree from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, and became a newspaper reporter. He worked for the <i>Commercial Appeal</i> in Memphis, the <i>Arkansas Gazette</i> in Little Rock, and the&nbsp;<i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, eventually becoming London bureau chief. He left that job to return to Arkansas--where he still lives--and write fiction.&nbsp;He is the author of five acclaimed novels: <i>Norwood</i>, <i>True Grit</i>, <i>The Dog of the South</i>, <i>Masters of Atlantis</i>, and <i>Gringos</i>. <i>True Grit</i> was adapted into two award-winning films, the first in 1969 starring John Wayne and the other in 2010 directed by the Coen brothers.<br><br>Jay Jennings lives in his hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas, where he is a freelance writer.

The press was also prohibited from the site, but with the help of the Museum of the City of New York and sympathetic city officials, award-winning photographer Joel Meyerowitz managed to obtain unlimited access. By ingenuity and sheer determination, he was the only photographer granted unimpeded right of entry into Ground Zero. <p> For 9 months, during the day and night, Meyerowitz photographed "the pile," as the World Trade Center came to be known, and the over 800 people a day that were working in it. Influenced by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange's work for the Farm Security Administration during the Great Depression, he knew that if he didn't make a photographic record of the unprecedented recovery efforts, "there would be no history." </p><p></p><p></p><p> <strong></strong> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><br> Sept. 23.

Booklist.<br>A Hamish Macbeth Mystery.<br>When Paul and Trixie Thomas move to the village of Lochdubh, Trixie jumps into things with a vengeance. She organizes an anti-smoking league, promotes vegetarian cooking, even starts a birdwatching society. It's too much . . . too perfect. It doesn't feel like the old Lochdubh anymore. So when Trixie is murdered, not everyone is exactly devastated. <br>Constable Macbeth, head over heels in love with beautiful Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, must interrupt his romance at the most inopportune time to solve the mystery. But how to do that when the list of suspects includes the entire town?</p><p><b>M. C. Beaton</b> worked as a Fleet Street journalist. She is the author of the 'Agatha Raisin' novels, the 'Hamish Macbeth' series and an 'Edwardian' murder-mystery series. She divides her time between Paris and the Cotswolds, where she lives in a village very much like Agatha's beloved Carsely.Constable Hamish Macbeth of Lochdubh in the Scottish Highlands returns to beguile readers in Beaton's fourth whodunit. With the arrival of Trixie and Paul Thomas from England, life in the tranquil village becomes chaotic, as brash Trixie establishes the Thomas house as headquarters for militant feminism. A "perfect wife," Trixie subjugates her husband Paul and teaches the local women to follow her example. Obeying Trixie's dicta, the wives begin serving their spouses health food instead of "harmful" hearty meals, and campaign vigorously against smoking. It is no wonder that someone eventually murders Trixie; Hamish's problem is whittling down the number of suspects. As the pace of the merry tale quickens, gentle Hamish draws nearer to exposing the surprising killer whose motive is far different from what he expects. He is also gratified to find the male residents of Lochdubh admitting that they feel better--although not smoking and eating nutritiously--now that they are relieved of Trixie's domineering presence. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Midworld</h2><p>Born was a child of the rain forest that covered Midworld, part of the primitive society that the peaceful jungle planet had sustained for hundreds of years.

Amazon reviews show that this book resonates deeply among readers, hikers and armchair travelers alike. &#34;While the narratives of other pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela are available in an array of languages, Soper stands out as a unique and rewarding guide.... for the quality and detail of her descriptive and narrative writing, as well as the interest level of her reflections.... Soper seems to have put as much care into her book as she did, indeed, into her pilgrimage. She imbued both works with dignity and relevance in a straightforward, honest manner that will not be lost on the reader. I tip my hat to a formidable traveler/writer.&#34; Judge, 22nd Annual Writer&#39;s Digest Self-Published Book Awards. Part memoir, part travelogue, Steps Out of Time details the fascinating history and traditions of this ancient way, its breathtaking beauty, great food, and extraordinary camaraderie. As well, it conveys the realities of a secular pilgrim&#39;s journey - the pain, the hilarious situations, the unexpected, and the moving. It is also a deeply reflective memoir on aging and the pace of modern life as seen through the eyes of a fifty-seven-year-old wife, mother, and professional who worries that recently diagnosed medical conditions might prevent her from accomplishing her goal. Her gender, stage in life, age (and hopefully, her maturity!) set the stage for her journey and the discoveries she makes along the way. This book is a book that will resonate with anyone who has felt overwhelmed by the pace and demands of life and who remembers - but cannot seem to recreate - a life that was calmer, richer and more fulfilling. All who desire to take that first step of personal rediscovery will want to read Steps Out of Time.</p><p></p><h2>The Secret Garden</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

Darby</b> was the founder and commanding officer of Darby's Rangers, the first unit of the US Army Rangers. The original draft of<i> Darby's Rangers</i> was dictated shortly before he was killed in action on April 30, 1945&#x2014;nine days before the conclusion of World War II.<b>Chapter I<br></b><i><br>North African Spearhead--Arzew<br><br>NOVEMBER 1942</i><br><i><br>Perspective </i><br><br>The summer of 1942 was an unforgettable time for the World War II Allies. Until that year, defeat had followed defeat. Pearl Harbor came first for the United States, and then the loss of the Philippines; Britain had its Dunkirk and had lost Singapore; and the Soviet Union was fighting a desperate battle against the Nazi Army on its entire Western front.<br><br>Darby's Rangers' first operations--Operation Torch of 8 November 1942--began with the war in North Africa in support of the Allied landing. This invasion had the backing of both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt, and the opposition of practically all the military staffs. It was first mentioned by the British at the Arcadia Conference in December 1941. They stressed the desirability of bringing French forces back into the war against Germany and thought of the North African operation as a relatively cheap means of seizing the initiative from Hitler. At the same time, the United States was busily engaged in the Pacific, particularly with the Guadalcanal operation which began on 7 August 1942. In late August 1942 the Soviet Union was to see the beginning of the Stalingrad attack by the Germans.<br><br>Churchill journeyed to Moscow to take news to Joseph Stalin, premier of the Soviet Union: the Western Allies were not going to invade the continent in 1942 but instead were to attack northwest Africa before the end of October. He gave Stalin the reasons for the inability of the Allies to help his beleaguered forces by drawing German divisions away through a continental attack. Churchill explained Operation Torch and what was hoped it would do; he was greatly surprised when Stalin agreed with its concept.<br><br>After Churchill's visit to Moscow, and with Roosevelt's complete approval, plans went ahead swiftly for the Allied invasion of North Africa. On 14 August the Combined Chiefs of Staff appointed Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, then in command of the American forces in England, to be commander of the Allied expeditionary force and directed him to prepare plans for the landing. Three task forces were developed for the operation. The Western Task Force was to capture Casablanca, the Central Task Force the city of Oran, and the Eastern Task Force the seaport of Algiers. In each case these amphibious landings were to be made in the classical historic mode of pinching off a seaport by attacking from the flanks, rather than head-on.<br><br>The Western Task Force, under the command of Maj. Gen. George S. Patton, included infantry troops and Maj. Gen. Ernest Harmon's armored forces. Harmon had elements of the 2nd Armored Division while the infantry was part of the 9th Infantry Division. The Central Task Force at Oran was commanded by Maj. Gen. Lloyd Fredendall and included the 1st Infantry Division and Maj. William Darby's Ranger Battalion. At Algiers the landing force consisted of a British division, a regimental combat team from the American forces, and three British Commando units.<br>IT WAS JUST THREE HOURS BEFORE THE START of the greatest amphibious operation in history with the hands of the ship's clock into 8 November 1942. I was standing on the bridge of H.M.S. Ulster Monarch with the master of the ship, trying to pierce the fog. Pricks of doubt ran through both our minds as we considered the assault landing to be made at Arzew, east of Oran, by my command, the 1st Ranger Battalion. Arzew was now some thirty miles off our starboard bow. Strange lights flickered in the distance along the shore, raising questions as to whether the landing force had been discovered. Knowing the importance of the assault landing, we were rubbing our hands nervously. What would the French do? Would they fight bitterly, or would they give up after their honor had been satisfied by strong resistance against an aggressive assault? A beacon, flashing its signal in a circle, spoke reassuringly. Perhaps the Rangers were going to make a landing in the dark without blue jets of flame crossing their path or large shells sending up waterspouts close by the landing boats.<br><br>The fog was growing thicker. I drifted over to the port side of the bridge and stared into the water, but close astern I could barely make out the misty outlines of H.M.S. Royal Scotsman and H.M.S. Royal Ulsterman, bearing the remainder of the 1st Ranger Battalion.<br><br>Suddenly I stiffened with fright. Cold chills ran down my spine and my hair literally stood on end. Two silver objects, racing with terrific speed, were heading for the ships. "My God, torpedoes! We've been discovered."<br><br>Clutching the master of the ship by the arm, I pointed shakily towards those streaks of foam in the sea. For a few seconds we stared at them in numbed silence. Nothing could be done since it was too late to take any evasive action. The streaks were within twenty-five yards of the ship and closing fast. As they approached nearer and nearer, I instinctively threw my hands to my head as if to protect myself from the expected explosion. Then as the objects were within a few yards of the ship, they leaped out of the water, throwing a fountain of spray. Diving gracefully, the two porpoises--for that was what they were--changed course to follow the ship. We mopped the perspiration from our foreheads and laughed weakly at one another's fears.<br><br>The North African invasion by United Nations forces was an awesome venture. The operation, carrying the hopes of many Allied peoples, was on a shoestring. Some of the landing craft, ships, and men had been made available just as the convoys were casting off from Great Britain and the United States. For months the public of the various countries of the United Nations had called for a second front; and when American troops first went to Northern Ireland and England, there was some feeling that the invasion of the continent was imminent. The soldiers on this expedition were not aware of any strategic decisions but knew only that they were going to the north coast of Africa, an area new to them and practically unknown to the average person on the streets at home.<br><br>As commanding officer of the 1st Ranger Battalion, I was well aware of the importance of the mission. Nervously I continued to scan the dim shapes all around. Beyond and to the rear of the three British ships bearing my battalion was a vast armada of assault ships protected by units of the British and American battle fleets. The Mediterranean was calm, but the fog and darkness gave little information as to the size of the swells through which the ships were pounding their deliberate passage.<br><br>I pondered the job ahead, certain that my unit--British-trained under Commando instructors and experienced in landing exercises in all kinds of weather on the islands west of Scotland--would fight smartly and courageously. There were nearly five hundred of us, each man versed in the use of weapons and aware of the importance of scrambling ashore and vaulting over the parapets of the forts. The coastal guns within had to be knocked out to make the landings of the main forces safe.<br><br>The three ships on which the Rangers were being carried to battle were British, British-manned, and bore the resounding title of His Majesty's Ships. Taken from the Glasgow-Belfast ferry run, they were small ships--never intended for battle.<br><br>When my men had first boarded the former ferryboats, they had a twinge of self-pity since they were obviously not built for combat, they were just the best available. Though Great Britain had a large merchant marine at the beginning of the war, they had had to scrape the barrel by 1942. Ships of all types and classes were handed their orders to join the military service and be converted, like these ferryboats, for assault use. The primary method of conversion was to rip out the luxury items and place davits inboard on the promenade deck to hold the landing craft.<br><br>The North African landing was to be a ship-to-shore operation rather than shore-to-shore. In the latter, men enter a large landing craft at a port, proceed across water, and land directly on a beach. This is the easier of the two, but for longer distances, ship-to-shore is a necessity. Men could not stay in even large landing craft over many hundreds of miles of open water without suffering from exposure which would make them unfit for an assault landing. By utilizing large ships carrying a number of small landing craft, fighting men can travel distances of more than a thousand miles and be disembarked several miles out to sea from their landing beach. This was the procedure for the North African operation.<br><br>The mother vessel is called an assault ship for another reason. Carrying necessary weapons, equipment, and supplies for the men aboard, it is "combat-loaded" so that everything is available in the priority needed. Guns and ammunition come first; food, shelter, and clothing next.<br><br>After the initial beach has been crossed and the defenses set up inland, succeeding waves of troops go ashore from ships which are "convoy-loaded" instead of "combat-loaded." In the former case, a number of ships bearing a battalion, a regiment, or a division, have all the initial supplies stowed economically throughout the convoy.<br><br>On 26 October 1942 the three ferryboats left their home port of Glasgow bound for Oran. They must have seemed like trusty old streetcars being sent out on a new and untried rail line. They steamed southward at good speed and eventually joined other groups of larger transports. The armada, gathered together like chickens in a barnyard, was protected by the mother hens of the fleets hovering in the distance. Only the superstructures of some of the men-of-war could be seen. Planes floated above the convoy all day in great easy circles, assuring the troops that aircraft carriers were accompanying them. Zigzagging, the convoy steamed south, headed like others presumably on the long voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt and the battle there against Rommel.<br><br>En route to North Africa, the convoys were subjected to a rough storm. Ships rolled from side to side. The Royal Scotsman lost one of the vital LCAs (landing craft, assault), which broke loose from its davits. A destroyer dropped back to sink it with gunfire so that no trace would be left for U-boats to pick up the armada's trail.<br><br>Initially many Rangers were seasick. Although hard men physically, keyed for battle and better trained than other American comrades in the expedition, they shuddered under the same fears, experienced the same chills, and succumbed to the same relentless roll of the ships. Aboard ship, we kept up a rigorous schedule of physical training. Setting-up exercises and runs around the deck took up much of the day, but at sundown the convoy area took on the look of a gigantic Fourth of July celebration. It began with a sputter as the Rangers tossed bottles and cans overboard for target practice. Rifles, automatic rifles, and machine guns spattered gunfire from the ships' sterns at the bobbing objects. Lieutenant Shunstrom, a former weight lifter, exhibited his muscles when he fired a string of bullets from a light machine gun held high over his head. The ships' crews tuned up their larger weapons. One ship would fire its antiaircraft guns; others trained on the shell bursts high in the air. The blazing sun dropped down on the ocean, halting the firing, and once more the convoy was wrapped in its protective coat of darkness.<br><br>Each day the Rangers had "skull practice." Like a good football team, we were planning and preparing for the payoff game. Officers discussed their plans on a large-scale plaster-of-paris model. Every section and platoon had maps and air photographs that showed the coast in the vicinity of Arzew in great detail. British and American intelligence agencies had supplied us with the most minute information about beaches, coastal guns, fortifications, and the arms of the French defenders.<br><br>Our objective area, the coast between Oran and Arzew, resembled a camel's back. Oran was on the eastern side of one hump, fronting on a large bay, and Arzew was thirty miles east on the eastern side of the next hump. The latter town looked across the broad Arzew Bay to the town of Mostaganem.<br><br>The plan was to land the 1st Division with the 16th and 18th Infantry Regiments to the east of Oran across the beaches of Arzew Bay and the 26th Infantry Regiment far to the west of Oran, to converge on Oran with two pincer movements and squeeze it off, thereby giving us the excellent naval base of Mers-el-Kebir and the port of Arzew itself.<br><br>I knew a month before we sailed that our mission was to capture, ahead of the 1st Division, the two gun batteries that dominated the long beach at Arzew.<br><br>Two separate coastal batteries were at Arzew: a small one at the harbor's edge named Fort de la Pointe and a larger position, Batterie du Nord, on a hill overlooking the harbor and the bay to the east. The latter was a more pretentious fort with a four-gun battery equipped with long-range rifles that could keep our fleet five miles at bay. They had the facilities for shooting in almost any direction. The guns were well sited and well controlled.<br><br>Our search for landing beaches disclosed only two between Arzew and Oran. Four miles northwest of Arzew at the top of the hump near Cap Carbon, was a beach suitable for the landing of a small force. Up the hump a short distance from Arzew was another small beach, appropriately named Cemetery Beach; the many offshore rocks noticeable in the air photographs made us shy away from a landing there. Assault boats would be broken up before they reached shore. The harbor of Arzew was the sole remaining possibility for a landing within our allotted sector.<br><br>The selection of landing locations was part of the problem confronting the Rangers. Knocking out two separate coastal batteries was another. We faced a dilemma: If the entire battalion attacked the smaller fort at the water's edge, we would very probably alert Batterie du Nord on the hill. If the Rangers attacked the larger fort first, French defenders would be alert and at "action stations" at Fort de la Pointe and other coastal defenses, and the boom in the harbor would be closed.<br><br>Contrary to standard practice, it was decided to split the 1st Ranger Battalion so as to attack both positions in a one-two punch. Four companies under my command were to attack the larger fort, while my executive officer, Maj. Herman Dammer, was to lead the remaining two companies against the harbor fort. (In the Rangers, every unit or task force was designated by the commanding officer's name, thus adding personality to their fighting.)<br><br>The Dammer Force aboard the Royal Scotsman had to replan their boat loading after the loss of the assault craft in the heavy Atlantic storm. Air photographs showed that Arzew on the eastern slope of the coastal hump had an artificial harbor enclosed by two jetties--the outer, or seaside jetty, pointing due south. Fort de la Pointe was situated at the land end of this sea jetty where it made a right angle with another sea jetty. The fort was composed of two separate positions. A barbed-wire enclosure guarded three coastal guns, and directly behind, there was a small French fort whose vertical walls were about twenty feet high. There were no guns in the walled fort.</p><h2>The Three Billy Goats Gruff (A First Little Golden Book) (English and Norwegian Edition)</h2><p>Three clever billy goats outwit a big ugly troll that lives under the bridge they must cross on their way to eat the sweet grass.</p><p>Text: English, Norwegian</p><h2>Let Me Go: An Archie Sheridan / Gretchen Lowell Novel</h2><p><p>"[A] masterful blend of psychological suspense and straight-up gore, chronicling the twisted bond between police detective Archie Sheridan and serial killer Gretchen Lowell."&#x2015;<i>Criminal Element</i></p><p>Detective Archie Sheridan just has to get through the next few days, then his birthday and Halloween will be over.

Ruth was born in Boston in 1905 and raised in the Territory of Alaska. She graduated from the University of Washington School of Music, and for twenty years she taught art and music in the Juneau schools. In 1949, she married Alaska pioneer Jack Allman. They lived in Southeast Alaska in Excursion Inlet and established Tongass Lodge, a remote base for hunters and fisherman forty miles northwest of Juneau. It was here that Ruth developed many of her sourdough recipes including her &#x201c;flaming sourdough waffles.&#x201d; After her husband died in 1953, Ruth devoted herself to being hostess and caretaker of the House of Wickersham, the judge's home on the hill overlooking Juneau and what shortly thereafter became the state capital. Ruth Allman passed away in 1989 at the age of eighty-four. She was one of Alaska's foremost sourdough historians.

Trained in Theater Arts and English, she now teaches English/Language Arts at a junior high school. Her poems for adults have appeared in more than twenty literary journals. McCall lives with her husband and their three sons in the San Antonio, Texas, area.After Odilia, 16, and her four younger sisters find a body floating in the river, they drive across the Mexican border to return the drowned man home. Their real mission, though, is to get to Abuelita&#x2019;s house and find their father, who abandoned Mam� and his daughters a year earlier. In true mythic style, the girls encounter heroes and monsters on their perilous, sometimes gruesome journey, including attacks by a coven of winged witches and creatures from Mexican folklore. After falling under the enchantment of an evil sorceress and an ancient fortune-teller, they are saved by Llorona, who looks monstrous but is the protector of the Azteca people and shows the five sisters their way. Just as compelling as the vivid fantasy is the realism, especially the standoffs and reconciliations among the caring sisters, and the final shocking truth about their father and themselves is far from a sweet resolution. Readers will be drawn by the contemporary family drama and the magic, and they&#x2019;ll appreciate the author&#x2019;s note that discusses the story&#x2019;s roots in Mexican folklore and The Odyssey.

The daughter of Jewish immigrants, Gruber was born and raised in Brooklyn, where her precocious academic abilities were soon recognized. Encouraged by mentors, she excelled, first in high school, then in college, majoring in English and German. Awarded scholarships, she went on to graduate school in Wisconsin and at the Univ. of Cologne. There, in 1932, where she became at 20 the youngest Ph.D. in Germany, she also witnessed the growing power of Hitler and the spread of anti-Semitism. Intent on being a writer, Gruber returned to New York, but because of the Depression, jobs were scarce, and she began writing free-lance pieces for the New York Herald Tribune. A travel fellowship enabled her to return to Europe in 1935 as a correspondent for the Tribune to study women under democracy, Fascism, and Communism, which she did by traveling in Germany, where old friends had either fled or joined the Nazis; in England, where she had a disappointing interview with Virginia Woolf; and in the Soviet Union, where she traveled in what we now know as the Gulag, first by train, then by plane, and finally by ship across the Arctic Ocean. A woman to admire, with a remarkable story that's undercut by lackluster prose and a tendency to deal superficially with the darker side of times past. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gruber ( Israel Today ), born in 1911, is not a household name despite her having written 13 books and serving as a foreign correspondent during the 1930s in countless dangerous locales. This memoir is beautifully crafted, covering her inner life sensitively as well as educating readers about what it was like to grow up Jewish in a Brooklyn "shtetl" in the early part of the century; to enter New York University as a 15-year-old freshman; to hitchhike to the University of Wisconsin to begin a master's degree in German; to study in Germany at the time of Hitler's ascension; and to explore Europe and the Soviet Arctic as a New York Herald Tribune journalist. Gruber changes some names for the sake of privacy, devaluing the book somewhat as a historical document. That reservation aside, this volume recalling her first 25 years is one of the most evocative journalistic autobiographies to appear. Readers will hope to see the rest of her story published.

This richly illustrated book presents the first comprehensive overview of Chase-Riboud&#39;s 30-year career as a sculptor and draftsman. Distinguished art historians Peter Selz and Anthony F. Janson show how history, archaeology, spiritualism, the Baroque tradition, and Chase-Riboud&#39;s parallel career as a poet-novelist (Sally Hemings, Echo of Lions) have influenced her work, from the Malcolm X, Tantra, Zanzibar, and Cleopatra series to her recent monument Africa Rising, the award-winning New York City landmark that commemorates a colonial slave-era African-American burial ground. 100 illustrations, 55 in full color, 9 x 1133/4&#34; Peter Selz is professor emeritus of art history at the University of California at Berkeley. A former curator of painting and sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, he is the author of 12 books on 20th-century art. Anthony F. Janson is professor of art history at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. He is author of the latest edition of Janson&#39;s History of Art as well as the exhibition catalogue Barbara Chase- Riboud: The Monument Drawings, and is a contributor to Abrams&#39; Vietnam: Reflexes and Reflections, among other titles.While Chase-Riboud--an African American poet, novelist, sculptor, and draftsperson--has been an artist for 30 years, much of it was created in Europe and remains little known in the United States. This volume, with essays by world-renowned critics and 100 mostly full-page illustrations, including 55 in color, makes an immediate impact and should help to raise her stature. Chase-Riboud's sculture melds bronze with sensuous cords made from gleaming silk that is knotted as it falls. Her drawings are exquisite, architectonic, and complex yet nearly minimalist. Themes include Cleopatra, Malcolm X, Pushkin, Queen Isabella, Egyptian gods and goddesses, holy sites, and "The Middle Passage Memorial" for the diaspora of those who crossed the Atlantic on slave ships, and her most important "Africa Rising." All of her work is sumptuously beautiful and well served by this fine catalog; highly recommended.<br><i>-Mary Hamel-Schwulst, Towson Univ., Millersville, MD. </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Three Keys to Self-Empowerment</h2><p>Three of Stuart Wilde&#x2019;s bestselling books are included in this self-empowering anthology . . . <p>MIRACLES <br>Stuart makes the point that creating miracles in our lives is no more complicated than understanding the metaphysics of the Universal Law, which states that within human beings there lies an immense power . . . and this power is impartial and unemotional. And because that law is indestructible and therefore infinite, we know that the power used by miracle-makers in the past is still available today. Yet, in our modern society, we are brought up to believe only in those things we can logically understand. We are not taught that the Universal Law has limitless potential or that this power is at our disposal and can be used to work miracles in our lives. </p><p>LIFE WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A STRUGGLE <br>Through a concerted action plan, this amusing work will help you quickly identify and eliminate the cause of struggle in your life.

She spent later years in Switzerland, the French Riviera and America, where she died in 1941.Von Arnim (1866-1941), whose novel, The Enchanted April , was recently made into a film, offers stinging social commentary in this 1940 novel. Fanny Skeffington, divorced 22 years earlier and the veteran of many love affairs, is approaching her 50th birthday when she begins to have visions of her philandering ex-husband at the breakfast table. Upset, she visits an "eminent nerve-and-women's-diseases specialist" who angers her by implying that she is old. Fanny then begins a journey that leads her from one former lover to another, and they react to the aging Fanny with varying degrees of dismay. When she visits one man in the country, his simple young wife flinches at her addressing both of them as "darling." She attends a Lent service given by a clergyman who once adored her and finds that he has taken vows of poverty and pities her. Eventually, odd circumstances reunite her with her ex-husband. Although Fanny's superficial observations are often comically ironic--she muses that lovers "set so high a standard for one when first they fell in love that the exertion of keeping up to it wore one out"--there is a lightweight feel to this story of aging ungracefully. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Railway Children</h2><p>When their father is sent away to prison, three London children move to the country where they keep busy preventing accidents on the nearby railway, making many new friends, and generally learning a good deal about themselves.</p><p>"It's a story that was written more than 100 years ago, yet <i>The Railway Children</i> commands the affections of the British people like few other fictions" (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"Guaranteed to jerk a tear from the most stony-faced child" (<i>Observer</i>)<br><br>"Her child characters were remarkable in her day because they are so entirely human.

He begins with Copernicus, during the Renaissance, when science replaced mysticism as a means of explaining the workings of the world, and he continues through the centuries, creating an unbroken genealogy of not only the greatest but also the more obscure names of Western science, a dot-to-dot line linking amateur to genius, and accidental discovery to brilliant deduction.<br><br>By focusing on the scientists themselves, Gribbin has written an anecdotal narrative enlivened with stories of personal drama, success and failure. A bestselling science writer with an international reputation, Gribbin is among the few authors who could even attempt a work of this magnitude.

It&#x2019;s the Porn Generation <p>It&#x2019;s everywhere, from commercials to New York Times bestsellers to college (and even younger) classrooms. In fact, pornography has become such a part of normal life in 21st century America that many teens and twenty-somethings have had no more important influence. They are the porn generation, where life&#x2019;s expectations come from Mouseketeer pop tarts, Victoria&#x2019;s Secret, Internet titillation, and condom-flogging sex education.</p><p>Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s novel Charlotte Simmons told part of the story&#x2014;but in Porn Generation it&#x2019;s for real. Ben Shapiro speaks as a member of this generation, and the tale he has to tell is a shocking perspective on life in an age where moral relativism reigns on college campuses, oversexed narcissism rules the airwaves, and purity is the new sin.</p><p>In Porn Generation you&#x2019;ll learn: � How porn producers see themselves as shaping and taking over Mainstreet U.S.A. � The real face of taxpayer-funded sex education: nine-year-olds learning about condoms; twelve-year-olds being questioned about their "sexual orientation" � The new collegiate do&#x2019;s (accepting "sexile") and don&#x2019;ts ("dormcest") � How Hollywood and TV have mainstreamed pornography: why porn stars now turn up regularly on television and in glossy ads&#x2014;and why celebrities imitate porn stars � Mamas, don&#x2019;t let your daughters grow up to be co-eds: why on college campuses&#x2014;and throughout the porn generation&#x2014;sexual relationships are as disposable as used condoms Is there any good news?

Ben Shapiro closes Porn Generation with a roundtable discussion that brings together the diverse perspectives of columnist and bestselling author Michelle Malkin, Dallas Morning News op-ed editor Rod Dreher, former Princeton chaplain Father C. J. McCloskey III, and columnist and bestselling author David Limbaugh to discuss how bad things have become and what the prospects are for bringing the porn generation back from the brink.

The biographical portion generally oversimplifies and sanitizes Wright's life, glossing over or ignoring major events (his desertion of his wife and family in 1909, his subsequent marriages and divorces) and his unconventional life style. Information is provided on many of the architect's most famous and significant buildings, but inexplicably the Guggenheim Museum isn't mentioned. The book begins with a helpful glossary, but lacks an index. Numerous black-and-white photographs illustrate the text. At first glance, the projects appear to be interesting. However, many are appropriate for older readers or for youngsters under close adult supervision-a safety precaution that is never suggested, although cooking, baking, and cutting are often required. Several errors further mar the text. An interesting exercise in abstract drawing refers readers to a nonexistent photograph and realistic drawing on the next page.

The influences of Frank Lloyd Wright's (1867-1959) Wisconsin childhood--nature, music and close family ties--come to life in the author's sympathetically told anecdotes. Extensive accounts of masterpieces like the Robie House, Hollyhock House and Fallingwater give heft to a comprehensive overview of the architect's career, which candidly notes his frequent trouble finding work. Twenty-one projects, ranging from making a plaster model textile block to preparing oatmeal (a Wright favorite), comprise the book's second half and nicely complement the portrait of a compelling artist. The edible graham-cracker-and-icing model of Fallingwater is priceless. Somber black-and-white photos, line drawings, a glossary, bibliography and list of houses to visit are included.

It was also the summer after Superman first appeared in <i>Action Comics</i> and instant coffee got popular, and the last full summer before the worst war. But they&#x2019;d talk about the flights first. They&#x2019;d say, how odd, for everyone to have spent so much time staring up at the sky, and to still not see it coming: a hurricane so punishing that it would destroy America&#x2019;s eastern seaboard, biting off the farthest tip of eastern Long Island, biting off a town called Montauk, and leaving it detached from the world, an island, alone, in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>It was September, only the last vestiges of summer remaining,when the hurricane hit. No one on Long Island knew thata storm was coming that afternoon. That the army would haveto come in to resurrect the land that had once connectedMontauk to the rest of Long Island. That it would take twoweeks before the waters receded low enough at Napeague to letthrough emergency traffic. That Montauk residents would losealmost everything.</p><p>In the end, there were only a few exceptions.

Her foot was on his shoulder.This was the only place they were touching. He almost reachedout, held her toes. But he knew it just made her mad when hedid anything tender. It made her think he&#x2019;d change, or want totry for her.</p><p>Then and only then did Champ sit up and look outside. Andmaybe it was that his head was still closed off, but what he sawout there looked like a train crashing into the window. It wasthe visual that made him hear the noise. The terrible whistling,high pitched and out of control. Hearing it, he&#x2019;d later say, wasthe moment his life changed.</p><p>He headed to the bedroom window, naked, and had to reachout, grip the long edge of the window frame to hold himself up.He couldn&#x2019;t see the beach, or the ocean. He couldn&#x2019;t see anythingat first.</p><p>Anna came up behind him, wrapped in the bedsheet, andthey stood there watching the train- wind through the window.They watched so hard that they didn&#x2019;t talk. Not about the speedof the wind or the trees breaking apart or what must have beenhappening in the town center. If they had been thinking, theymight have moved away from the window. They might have beenscared that it would splinter. But they stood there until thestorm stopped, and started, and stopped for good. And thegreenish yellow sky turned purple and then black and the sun(or was it the moon?) rose up, terrifying. It was the sun. Theyhad watched through the night.</p><p> &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t answer her.</p><p>&#x201c;What do we do now?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Champ was already in motion. He was putting on clothesand lacing up his work boots and walking out the front door. Hemade his way, by foot, across his land, down the slippery bluffsand tree- wrecked cliffs onto the flooded Napeague stretch anddown farther to Main Street. Three and a half miles. Into thecenter of the ruined village.</p><p>There were fishing boats and cars piled on small houses.Fallen phone lines pulling down torn roofs. Poles and floodedcabinets and bed frames lining the street. Water was fl owingfrom everywhere, making it hard to even walk down thestreets&#x2014;where did it start? If they figured out where it startedmaybe they could stop it!</p><p>Champ pulled up his pant legs and made his way to theManor, where people were setting up shelter, where they weretrying to provide relief for themselves. And Champ set to workwith the other men moving cars and carrying wet wood andboarding windows and drying blankets and cleaning up slabsof broken glass.</p><p>How could he explain it even to himself? He didn&#x2019;t recognizethe feeling, had never known it before. But something brokefree in Champ&#x2014;something like devotion or commitment&#x2014;tohis home, to his suffering town, to everything around him.Maybe this is why, when he finished working, he didn&#x2019;t headhome, but down to the docks, where he sat on canisters with allthe fishermen, who now had nothing, and listened to them talkabout how they had nothing, and stared at his own cut hands,and watched the moon rise, white and fierce, remarkably sure ofitself.</p><p>Then he followed the star- line north and east, trying to locateit. First Montauk Point, then the cliff and the bluffs, thenthe house itself. His house. Huntington Hall. Standing tall,oblivious.</p><p>It was hard to find his way back there in the dark. So he followedthe defeated shoreline, and eventually made his way upthe wooden staircase, into the bluffs, toward his home, whereeverything was still mostly together. Where Anna was waitingwith lit candles and tomato sandwiches, dark blankets spreadout on the living room floor.</p><p>When he walked in, she was by the front door. She waswearing a long, purple sweater. She had her hair in a bun. Shereached for him, and he buried into her neck, smelled her.</p><p>&#x201c;How was town?&#x201d; she asked, her hand still on his chest. &#x201c;Itried to pick up news on the radio, but there was no reception. Isthere a town left?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t answer her, but he was looking at her strangely.And he knew that she knew he was looking at her strangely. Itwas as simple as this: he could see her. For the first time in ayear, there was nowhere else he was trying to be.</p><p>Which brought him to his own questions: Why did it takefear to move him? Why does it take chaos to make us understandexactly what we need to do?</p><p>He wanted to ask her his questions, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure shewould have good answers, and then he would change his mind,and he didn&#x2019;t want to change his mind. He wanted to stay thissure.</p><p>Later, only thirty hours since he had last been lying t here,they were lying on the floor together, facing each other. And inthat strange way that we make decisions, the important decisionsthat ultimately make us, Champ decided that they weregoing to stay in Montauk full time. No more New York City.This had become their home.</p><p>He turned and looked outside at the slowly recovering world.At the backlit colors in the sky, on his lawn. And he knew thetruth. The main truth, at least. This house had saved them.This big, beautiful cottage, which stayed big and beautiful despitethe destruction all around. Its stern banisters and woodceilings and determined rafters. The house had saved him, andhe wasn&#x2019;t going to forget it.</p><p>He was going to build his life here, right here, in the name oflove and honor and what ever else he was feeling, even if hecouldn&#x2019;t name it for what it was: exhaustion.</p><p>He was, finally, exhausted.</p><p>He looked Anna right in the eye. &#x201c;Things are going to be different,&#x201d;he said.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying,&#x201d; he said, because they&#x2019;d talked about the opposite,earlier, before&#x2014;his leaving her, and here.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I want to,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She got quiet. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to disappoint me,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Probably.&#x201d; He was trying to make a joke, but it didn&#x2019;t comeout that way. He tried again. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s going to turn out okay,&#x201d;he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Starting when?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Ending when?&#x201d;</p><p>Then, as if it were an answer, he pulled her in close to him,without reluctance, without anything like fear. &#x201c;This house,&#x201d; hesaid, &#x201c;will see love. This house will see everything.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>At Home with Art: How Art Lovers Live with and Care for Their Treasures</h2><p><b>At Home with Art</b> is about art lovers, their passion for art, and their seemingly unquenchable desire to bring home the works that have captured their hearts. Whether the artworks are Picassos or posters, these people want to acquire and live with the art they love. "I wake up in the morning and exercise where I can look at it," says John Robson about one of the paintings in his San Francisco townhouse. How these art lovers integrate their finds <br>into their living spaces, juxtaposing their paintings and sculpture with the artifacts of everyday life -- furniture, rugs, books, lamps, objets d'art -- is vividly illustrated here in more than fifty homes inhabited by people for whom living with art is as essential as breathing.<br><br>These homes are not mini-museums with art to be admired from a respectful distance. Nor have they been designed by interior decorators whose goal is to harmonize the upholstery with the pictures. Each home has been chosen for its very personal and inspired expression of art and decor, revealing a deep, even spiritual, relationship between the pictures on the walls and the people who place them there. From airy lofts and old farmhouses to sleek city apartments and cozy traditional houses, all are made special by the paintings and sculptures within.<br><br>A wide variety of people appear in these pages, from the president of MoMA to a young man in love with poster art, to the writer who has artist friends, to the young woman who inherited pieces from her mother, to the actress whose art travels with her wherever she goes. The kinds of art that speak to them and that they are impelled to acquire range from old masters to outsider art, from folk art to contemporary art, to prints, drawings, photographs, and sculpture. We learn about what sparked their interest in a particular genre, how they make their selections, how they meld them into their homes, and what living with their art means to them.<br><br>Though looking at these interiors proves there are no fixed rules about displaying a work of art, special sections on framing, hanging, lighting, and caring for art, from oil paintings to delicate works on paper, provide technical assistance. A directory includes framers, dealers, auction houses, and restorers in major American cities and in London.<br><br>Above all, <b>At Home with Art</b> shows that there are all kinds of art to be loved and cherished, however grand or simple, and that living surrounded by art's beauty can bring boundless personal satisfaction.</p><p><b>Estelle Ellis</b>, coauthor of At Home with Books, is a pioneering figure in the world of magazine publishing whose marketing programs are preserved in the Smithsonian Center for Advertising History.

This definitive narrative history documents significant events across the globe from 1900 through 1999.</p><p>Gilbert, author of the multivolume biography of Winston Churchill and other brilliant works of history, chronicles world events year by year, from the dawn of aviation to the flourishing technology age, taking us through World War I to the inauguration of Franklin Roosevelt as president of the United States and Hitler as chancellor of Germany, and continuing on to document wars in South Africa, China, Ethiopia, Spain, Korea, Vietnam, and Bosnia, apartheid, the arms race, the moon landing, and the dawn of the computer age. He moves from the Hungarian revolution to Poland's solidarity movement to Ireland's Bloody Sunday and Israel's confrontations with the Palestinians; from Pol Pot's Cambodia to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As always, Gilbert intersperses the influence of art, literature, music, and religion, as well as highlighting both man-made and natural disasters, to further enliven this vivid work.</p><p>This is a rich, textured look at war, celebration, suffering, life, death, and renewal in the century gone by. The result is nothing less than extraordinary.</p></p><p><p>Martin Gilbert is Winston Churchill's biographer and the author of eight acclaimed books on the Holocaust. He lives in London.</p>After writing more than 50 books, the eminent British historian, knighted in 1995, could be excused for feeling tired, and this first volume of his history of the 20th century shows it. One of the problems is that he has chosen to cover the period year by year, with the result that, like a butterfly, he alights briefly on one country before winging his way to the next. This tends to interrupt the flow of the narrative and the development of any themes. The only exception is where he describes the First World War, on which he has already written much, and where the inherent drama of the events imposes its own theme. Another problem lies in a lack of freshness in the writing: ``the ever-changing, ever-renewing drama on the world stage. . . . Everywhere mankind strove, and continues to strive for that better tomorrow.'' A further problem, most unexpected in a historian of Gilbert's accomplishment, is his use of sources. For example, although he describes it as a ``patriotic volume published annually,'' he quotes Cassell's Illustrated History of England at length and almost uncritically: ``Never was there a touch of nature that made the whole world more kin than the death of her Majesty the Queen of England.'' The First World War dominates the period, occupying a quarter of the book, but Gilbert gives little indication of why statesmen, with few exceptions (Churchill in England, Count Tisza in Austria-Hungary), were so blind to its potential consequences and why the peoples of Europe greeted the declaration of war with such enthusiasm. The good bits tend to suggest ``Trivial Pursuits'': In 1906, for example, Coca-Cola replaced the cocaine in its drink with caffeine, and Lindbergh's achievements finally convinced the American people that the airplane was safe. Churchill, whose biographer Gilbert is, would have called this volume a ``themeless pudding.'' (24 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Until now, those failures have been attributed largely to individual mistakes. But Zegart shows how and why the intelligence system itself left us vulnerable.</p><br><p> Zegart argues that after the Cold War ended, the CIA and FBI failed to adapt to the rise of terrorism. She makes the case by conducting painstaking analysis of more than three hundred intelligence reform recommendations and tracing the history of CIA and FBI counterterrorism efforts from 1991 to 2001, drawing extensively from declassified government documents and interviews with more than seventy high-ranking government officials. She finds that political leaders were well aware of the emerging terrorist danger and the urgent need for intelligence reform, but failed to achieve the changes they sought. The same forces that have stymied intelligence reform for decades are to blame: resistance inside U.S. intelligence agencies, the rational interests of politicians and career bureaucrats, and core aspects of our democracy such as the fragmented structure of the federal government. Ultimately failures of adaptation led to failures of performance. Zegart reveals how longstanding organizational weaknesses left unaddressed during the 1990s prevented the CIA and FBI from capitalizing on twenty-three opportunities to disrupt the September 11 plot.</p><br><br><p> <i>Spying Blind</i> is a sobering account of why two of America's most important intelligence agencies failed to adjust to new threats after the Cold War, and why they are unlikely to adapt in the future.</p></p><p><br><p>"There is no longer any doubt of the failure of our intelligence agencies in the years following the Cold War. Amy Zegart has examined the reasons for this failure in addition to the well-meaning but mistaken attempts to address the problem. An important book for all those interested in the nation's security."<b>--Thomas H. Kean, chairman of the 9/11 Commission and former governor of New Jersey</b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Spying Blind</i> is a timely and sweeping overview of the organizational challenges confronting our intelligence agencies in an age of terrorism. Amy Zegart has written a comprehensive and engaging book that will be of interest to anyone who seeks a better understanding of America's national-security agencies."<b>--Lee Hamilton, president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</b><br></p><br><p>"Amy Zegart has written a pathbreaking book--picking a path through the rubble of countless reform commissions, congressional committees, and expert reports on how to adapt U.S. intelligence infrastructure to a post-Cold War, post-9/11 world. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with the theory or practice of national security in the twenty-first century."<b>--Anne-Marie Slaughter, dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University</b><br></p><br><p>"Amy Zegart believes, quite rightly, that even six years after the terrorist attacks the government of the United States continues to be plagued by deep-seated institutional deficiencies within the community of intelligence agencies. This outstanding book, clearly written and exhaustively researched, stands as a major contribution to our understanding of why this is the case, and what can be done about it."<b>--Loch K. Johnson, University of Georgia</b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Spying Blind</i> is both a clarion call for organizational reform of the intelligence community and a sober warning that effective reforms will not be forthcoming unless Congress also changes the way it manages our intelligence agencies."<b>--Scott D. Sagan, Stanford University</b><br></p><br><p>"An outstanding demonstration of how the adaptation failures of the CIA and FBI before and after 9/11 lie in deep-rooted organizational deficiencies and not individuals asleep at the switch."<b>--Graham Allison, Harvard University</b><br></p><br><p>"Professor Zegart's work is breathtaking in scope and revolutionary. This is the first effort to put the CIA and other intelligence agencies under the microscope of social science."<b>--Gary Hart, former senator and chairman of the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st Century</b><br></p><br><p>"This is an excellent book. The writing is gracious and many of the turns of phrase are both eye-catching and very satisfying. The documentation is extensive but straightforward and not cumbersome. The book moves along briskly--a good read. This is not common in the political-science literature and certainly not with a subject matter such as intelligence."<b>--Charles Perrow, author of<i>The Next Catastrophe</i><br></b><br></p><br><p>"The book's central argument is that the U.S. intelligence agencies did not adapt to the changed world after the cold war and have not shown much sign of adapting even after 9/11. While most academics hedge in language, Zegart's is straightforward. The writing is very clean and readable. The book rests on a lot of research."<b>--Gregory F. Treverton, author of<i>Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information</i><br></b><br></p><br><b>Amy B.

When Romola, the virtuous daughter of a blind scholar, marries Tito Melema, a charismatic young Greek, she is bound to a man whose escalating betrayals threaten to destroy all that she holds dear.

Filled with inspiring stories and quotes from real women who have battled nicotine addiction, this follow-up addresses the unique difficulties females face when they decide to quit. Carr and Francesca Cesati focus on those issues of special concern to women, such as weight gain, increased stress, and smoking during pregnancy making this the perfect gift for any woman who lights up and wants to stop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Allen Carr was an accountant and smoked 100 cigarettes a day until he gave up and wrote this bestselling book. He has built a hugely successful network of stop-smoking clinics across the world and is the author of The Only Way to Stop Smoking, How to Stop Your Child Smoking, The Easy Way to Enjoy Flying and The Easyweigh to Lose Weight. In 2004 Allen published his bestselling autobiography Packing It In (Michael Joseph). He was diagnosed with lung cancer in the summer of 2006 and died in November of the same year. It seems likely that the years he spent curing smokers in smoke-filled sessions at his clinics must have contributed to this illness, but Allen Carr remained positive; "Given that I am informed that I have cured at least 10 million smokers on a conservative estimation, it's a price worth paying."</p></p><h2>Jesus</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Crossan paints his Jesus with great warmth and power.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Dominic Crossan is widely regarded as the leading authority on the words and life of Jesus Christ. His classic national bestseller, <em>Jesus</em>, is a powerful and controversial portrait of a courageous revolutionary, philosopher, and political agitator who challenged the prevailing rules of the social order. Bold, moving, and provocative, a book that will affect every Christian reader deeply and profoundly, <em>Jesus </em>is a remarkable work that presents a very different view of a savior and king of peace who proclaimed&#x2014;in thought and action&#x2014;that all may participate in the rule of God.</p></p><p>John Dominic Crossan, widely regarded as the leading authority on the words and life of Jesus, cuts through the minutiae and arcane research of much biblical scholarship to present the best possible historical depiction of Jesus--the man and his message. In elegant prose marked by startling revelations, Crossan presents Jesus as a social revolutionary who preached and practiced a message of radical egalitarianism. The Jesus portrayed by Crossan is a savvy and courageous Jewish Mediterranean peasant who challenged the sacrosanct social rules regarding class, gender, and status. What emerges from this stunning biography is a vision of Jesus as a Jewish Socratic philosopher and political agitator who gave voice to those who had never been heard and love to the most cast-out members of society. He proclaimed--in thought and action--that all may participate in the rule of God.<p> John Dominic Crossan&#x2018;s bestselling and critically acclaimed biography of the historical Jesus.

If an artist is measured by their devotion to their craft, <i>Harlem to Hollywood</i> may be the purest treatise on the subject ever produced. All the better, it's also an astounding story.<br><br>Born into a white, suburban family, Vera fell for black music as a child and started down a winding performer's path that would buoy him the rest of his life. In the sixties, Vera paid his bills by songwriting (for other artists) through the day and playing mobbed up clubs at night. By 1967, as Newark burned on the other side of the Hudson, he and gospel singer Judy Clay, the first interracial duet to perform at the Apollo, tore the house down with a little ditty he wrote for himself: &#x201c;Storybook Children &#x201d; a commercial hit produced by Atlantic Records. Through the seventies, popular taste shifted drastically. As blue-eyed soul went out of fashion, Vera, like many other musicians, found himself scrounging for survival gigs, but one crucial difference set him apart: he abstained from the drugs and drink that fueled &#x2013; and eventually claimed &#x2013; so many of his contemporaries. As that decade sputtered to a close, a woman by the name of Dolly Parton recorded Vera's &#x201c;I Really Got the Feeling&#x201d; and hit number one on the charts. Riding the tide of this unexpected attention, Vera hightailed it to Los Angeles, formed a new band, Billy and the Beaters, and charted twice before the close of 1981 with songs from their eponymous album recorded live at the Roxy. Five years later, one of these minor hits, &#x201c;At This Moment &#x201d; was featured in several episodes of NBC's <i>Family Ties</i>. The song rocketed up the charts and a 42-year-old Vera found himself with his very own number one single. Nine visits to Carson and an American Bandstand appearance later, Vera tasted many other flavors of success: acting both on- and off-camera, producing records, and reissuing his own work. Today, with a star on the Hollywood Walk and Fame and a Grammy in tow, he's finally prepared to share his journey (did we mention that he's also a photographer and music historian who documented every step of career?).<br><br>To sit down with Billy Vera is to take a personalized tour through nearly fifty years of entertainment history.

His songs have been recorded by stars like Ricky Nelson, Fats Domino, Bonnie Raitt, Lou Rawls, Dolly Parton, Robert Plant, Etta James, Eric Burdon, Tom Jones, and Michael Bubl�.

Anne Graham Lotz says the answer is knowing God intimately as Abraham did---and being known by Him---as His friend.</p><p>God longs to call you friend. Are you missing the essentials to living a joyful, purpose-filled life? Are you devoted to your church or your religion but still struggling to find meaning and passion in your faith? Do you love your family, work hard, contribute to your community, but still feel your life is somehow incomplete and hollow at the core? Are you restless in your spirit, with a nagging sense that there must be something more? Gifted Bible teacher Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of evangelist Billy Graham, has known this struggle herself. As she studied Scripture looking for a way out of the emptiness, she found her answer in the amazing story of Abraham, a very ordinary man who became extraordinary for one pivotal reason: he pursued God in a life of obedient faith, not knowing where that decision would take him. Despite struggling, as we do, with compromise, fear, family, quarrels, failure, doubt, and disappointment, Abraham became a man God called His friend. Anne followed Abraham&#39;s lead and began a lifelong pursuit of knowing God, as he truly is, in an intensely personal relationship. Through personal anecdotes, unforgettable stories, and God-inspired insights, she invites you to draw closer to God, who is as committed to you as he was to Abraham and longs to call you friend.Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of Billy and Ruth Graham, is the president and CEO of AnGeL Ministries, a nonprofit organization that undergirds her efforts to draw people into a life-changing relationship with God through his Word. Anne has spoken on seven continents, in more than twenty foreign countries, proclaiming the Word of God in arenas, churches, seminaries, and prisons. She is the award-winning author of nine books, including her signature book, Just Give Me Jesus. In 2000 she launched her revival ministry, also entitled Just Give Me Jesus.

Recommended for all public and academic libraries. <br></i> -- Library Journal</b> </p><p> The remarkable adaptations of turtles, tortoises and terrapins have helped them survive for over 200 million years. They are the most wide-ranging of reptiles, found in deserts, forests and the open ocean. But they are also among the world's most endangered animals. They face the multiple threats of habitat destruction, poaching, overhunting (for food and traditional medicines), deadly tangles with fishing lines and capture for the international pet trade. Around the world, turtle populations are under attack on land and sea. Many species are close to extinction and efforts are underway to save them. It is among the main goals of this book to foster awareness about these unique and threatened creatures. </p><p> In this new edition, zoologist Ronald Orenstein describes the astonishing ways that turtles cope with their environment. He updates readers on the latest discoveries and explores the debate on origins of the turtle. Every aspect of their evolution, life history and conservation status is presented in 250 photographs and lively text supplemented with numerous maps and a bibliography. </p><p> The battle to save turtles goes on. <b><i>Turtles, Tortoises and Terrapins</i></b> is fascinating, informative and essential for anyone interested in these amazing creatures and concerned about their precarious future. </p></p><p><p><b>Ronald Orenstein</b> is a zoologist, lawyer and wildlife conservationist who has written extensively on a wide range of natural history issues. </p><p> PREFACE: Why Turtles Matter </p><p> "Turtles," Anders Rhodin of the Chelonian Research Foundation wrote over ten years ago, "are in terrible trouble." I began the preface to the first edition of this book with his words. For the second edition I can do no better than quote him again, this time from a statement he made in 2011: "Turtles are in serious trouble. They are some of the world's most endangered vertebrates, more than mammals, birds, or even highly endangered amphibians." </p><p> Few herpetologists--the scientists who study reptiles and amphibians--would disagree with him. His 2011 statement was made upon the release of a multi-authored report, <i>Turtles in Trouble: The World's 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles--2011</i>, detailing just how bad things are. Half of the turtle species in the world are threatened with extinction. There is hardly a place left on earth, land or sea where turtles are safe. In some places, most particularly in southern Asia where forests and rivers are being swept clean of turtles to supply growing and voracious markets for food and pets, their situation is little short of desperate. Some species have probably already disappeared; more will almost certainly do so, or be reduced to an existence in captive colonies, despite efforts we make to save them. Pollution, habitat destruction, overhunting, climate change and disease strike at species after species. During the last five years of the 20th century, populations of the largest turtle in the world, the Leatherback Sea Turtle (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>), collapsed throughout the Pacific Ocean. Poachers are stealing the beautiful Radiated Tortoise (<i>Astrochelys radiata</i>), even from national parks. The unique Central American River Turtle (<i>Dermatemys mawii</i>), the only living representative of its family, is being eaten out of existence. </p><p> There is more to turtles than most of us know. We think of them as the quintessence of slowness. When Camille Saint-Sa'ns assigned music to the tortoise in <i>Carnival of the Animals</i>, it was Jacques Offenbach's famous cancan--played at a glacial pace. But anyone who lets a careless hand get too close to an angry snapper or softshell will learn just how rapidly a turtle can move. The Big-headed Turtle (<i>Platysternon megacephalum</i>) of Southeast Asia can scale a slippery boulder or even climb into a tree. The Pig-nose Turtle (<i>Carettochelys insculpta</i>) of Australasia can dart away at four times the speed of a swimming human, and a sea turtle can fly through the water with balletic grace. </p><p> Imagine if turtles had vanished long ago, with the dinosaurs, and we knew them only from fossils. Surely we would be amazed that such bizarre creatures, sealed in bone, ribs welded to their shells, had existed; had ranged successfully almost throughout the world, in deserts, rivers, and forests, and far out into the open sea; had dug burrows that became homes for other creatures; had a role to play in the habitats where they lived. We would regret that we had missed the opportunity to see them plodding their way through ancient forests, beneath the feet of monsters. </p><p> But turtles, unlike so many other reptiles of past ages, did survive, and for many of us they are a commonplace. Some of us think of them with amusement, as comic-strip characters, plush toys for children, or dancing, top-hatted figures on a box of candy. For others, turtles are a source of food and income, whether from selling a tortoise as a pet or showing tourists a sea turtle laboriously digging its nest in the sand. For some, turtles are even an object of veneration, to be protected and fed on the grounds of a temple. Humankind sees turtles as anything but what they really are: highly evolved, remarkable creatures, necessary components of their shrinking and ever more degraded ecosystems. We in the West have ceased to be amazed by them. </p><p> I have written this book because turtles do amaze me. I am not a herpetologist but an ornithologist, a student of birds, and turtles were always on the periphery of my attention. I could not help, though, collecting bits and pieces of information about them, and the more I learned the more astonished I became at the sheer range of adaptation in such superficially humble creatures. </p><p> As I have gone on from ornithology to a career in wildlife conservation, lobbying against the excesses of the international wildlife trade, turtles have come more and more into the center of my vision. In recent years, I have supported the ban on international trade in tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the Hawksbill Sea Turtle (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>), and joined efforts to regulate the almost uncontrolled turtle markets of eastern Asia. I have tried to become not just an admirer of turtles but one of their advocates. </p><p> If you are not one already, I hope that this book will make you, too, their admirer and advocate. Turtles should fill you with a sense of wonder, and our treatment of them should fill you with a sense of concern. I know it is entirely unscientific to ascribe human qualities to the processes of evolution, but it is hard not to admire turtles for their sheer doggedness in having successfully made it this far; that they are here for us to wonder at means that we should wonder at them, and make sure that our children and grandchildren have the chance to do the same. </p><p> In 1953, the authors of <i>Reptiles and Amphibians: A Guide to Familiar American Species</i> wrote that turtles (and lizards, and snakes) "are interesting and unusual, although of minor importance. If they should all disappear, it would not make much difference one way or the other." Although we know better today, it is our generation that is presiding over their disappearance. </p><p> It is up to us to rescue turtles from the terrible trouble in which we have placed them. Turtles matter because of what they are; because of the path they have taken; because of their role in the natural world; because of their impact, over the centuries, on our society, culture and even our religions. They matter because it would be shameful if their long tread through 200 million years of evolutionary history should end through our negligence, our greed and our failure to act. </p></p><h2>Chasing a Blond Moon: A Woods Cop Mystery (Woods Cop Mysteries)</h2><p>Strange things are happening to the black bears of the Upper Peninsula.

He vows to sit in the hollow where the mortar fell and play Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio once a day for each of the twenty-two victims. The Adagio had been re-created from a fragment after the only extant score was firebombed in the Dresden Music Library, but the fact that it had been rebuilt by a different composer into something new and worthwhile gives the cellist hope.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kenan steels himself for his weekly walk through the dangerous streets to collect water for his family on the other side of town, and Dragan, a man Kenan doesn&#x2019;t know, tries to make his way towards the source of the free meal he knows is waiting. Both men are almost paralyzed with fear, uncertain when the next shot will land on the bridges or streets they must cross, unwilling to talk to their old friends of what life was once like before divisions were unleashed on their city. Then there is &#x201c;Arrow,&#x201d; the pseudonymous name of a gifted female sniper, who is asked to protect the cellist from a hidden shooter who is out to kill him as he plays his memorial to the victims.<br><br>In this beautiful and unforgettable novel, Steven Galloway has taken an extraordinary, imaginative leap to create a story that speaks powerfully to the dignity and generosity of the human spirit under extraordinary duress.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><p>Steven Galloway is the author of <i>Finnie Walsh</i>, <i>Ascension </i>and <i>The Cellist of Sarajevo</i>.</p>The Cellist<br>It screamed downward, splitting air and sky without effort. A target expanded in size, brought into focus by time and velocity. There was a moment before impact that was the last instant of things as they were. Then the visible world exploded.<br><br>In 1945, an Italian musicologist found four bars of a sonata&#x2019;s bass line in the remnants of the firebombed Dresden Music Library. He believed these notes were the work of the seventeenth-century Venetian composer Tomaso Albinoni, and spent the next twelve years reconstructing a larger piece from the charred manuscript fragment. The resulting composition, known as Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio, bears little resemblance to most of Albinoni&#x2019;s work and is considered fraudulent by most scholars. But even those who doubt its authenticity have difficulty denying the Adagio&#x2019;s beauty.<br><br>Nearly half a century later, it&#x2019;s this contradiction that appeals to the cellist. That something could be almost erased from existence in the landscape of a ruined city, and then rebuilt until it is new and worthwhile, gives him hope. A hope that, now, is one of a limited number of things remaining for the besieged citizens of Sarajevo and that, for many, dwindles each day.<br><br>And so today, like every other day in recent memory, the cellist sits beside the window of his second-floor apartment and plays until he feels his hope return. He rarely plays the Adagio. Most days he&#x2019;s able to feel the music rejuvenate him as simply as if he were filling a car with gasoline. But some days this isn&#x2019;t the case. If, after several hours, this hope doesn&#x2019;t return, he will pause to gather himself, and then he and his cello will coax Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio out of the firebombed husk of Dresden and into the mortar-pocked, sniper-infested streets of Sarajevo. By the time the last few notes fade, his hope will be restored, but each time he&#x2019;s forced to resort to the Adagio it becomes harder, and he knows its effect is finite. There are only a certain number of Adagios left in him, and he will not recklessly spend this precious currency.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t always like this. Not long ago the promise of a happy life seemed almost inviolable. Five years ago at his sister&#x2019;s wedding, he&#x2019;d posed for a family photograph, his father&#x2019;s arm slung behind his neck, fingers grasping his shoulder. It was a firm grip, and to some it would have been painful, but to the cellist it was the opposite. The fingers on his flesh told him that he was loved, that he had always been loved, and that the world was a place where above all else the things that were good would find a way to burrow into you. Though he knew all of this then, he would give up nearly anything to be able to go back in time and slow down that moment, if only so he could more clearly recall it now. He would very much like to feel his father&#x2019;s hand on his shoulder again.<br><br>He can tell today won&#x2019;t be an Adagio day. It has been only a half-hour since he sat down beside the window, but already he feels a little bit better. Outside, a line of people wait to buy bread. It&#x2019;s been over a week since the market&#x2019;s had any bread to buy, and he considers whether he might join them. Many of his friends and neighbours are in line. He decides against it, for now. There&#x2019;s still work to do.<br>It screamed downward, splitting air and sky without effort. A target expanded in size, brought into focus by time and velocity. There was a moment before impact that was the last instant of things as they were. Then the visible world exploded.<br><br>When the mortars destroyed the Sarajevo Opera Hall, the cellist felt as if he were inside the building, as if the bricks and glass that once bound the structure together became projectiles that sliced and pounded into him, shredding him beyond recognition. He was the principal cellist of the Sarajevo Symphony Orchestra. That was what he knew how to be. He made the idea of music an actuality. When he stepped on stage in his tuxedo he was transformed into an instrument of deliverance. He gave to the people who came to listen what he loved most in the world. He was as solid as the vice of his father&#x2019;s hand.<br><br>Now he doesn&#x2019;t care whether anyone hears him play or not. His tuxedo hangs in the closet, untouched. The guns perched on the hills surrounding Sarajevo have dismantled him just as they have the opera hall, just as they have his family home in the night while his father and mother slept, just as they will, eventually, everything.<br><br>The geography of the siege is simple. Sarajevo is a long ribbon of flat land surrounded on all sides by hills. The men on the hills control all the high ground and one peninsula of level ground in the middle of the city, Grbavica. They fire bullets and mortars and tank shells and grenades into the rest of the city, which is being defended by one tank and small hand-held weapons. The city is being destroyed.<br><br>The cellist doesn&#x2019;t know what is about to happen. Initially the impact of the shell won&#x2019;t even register. For a long time he&#x2019;ll stand at his window and stare. Through the carnage and confusion he&#x2019;ll notice a woman&#x2019;s handbag, soaked in blood and sparkled with broken glass. He won&#x2019;t be able to tell whom it belongs to. Then he&#x2019;ll look down and see he has dropped his bow on the floor, and somehow it will seem to him that there&#x2019;s a great connection between these two objects. He won&#x2019;t understand what the connection is, but the feeling that it exists will compel him to undress, walk to the closet and pull the dry cleaner&#x2019;s plastic from his tuxedo.<br><br>He will stand at the window all night and all through the next day. Then, at four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, twenty-four hours after the mortar fell on his friends and neighbours while they waited to buy bread, he will bend down and pick up his bow. He will carry his cello and stool down the narrow flight of stairs to the empty street. The war will go on around him as he sits in the small crater left at the mortar&#x2019;s point of impact. He&#x2019;ll play Albinoni&#x2019;s Adagio. He&#x2019;ll do this every day for twenty-two days, a day for each person killed. Or at least he&#x2019;ll try. He won&#x2019;t be sure he will survive. He won&#x2019;t be sure he has enough Adagios left.<br><br>The cellist doesn&#x2019;t know any of this now, as he sits at his window in the sun and plays. He isn&#x2019;t yet aware. But it&#x2019;s already on its way. It screams downward, splitting air and sky without effort. A target expands in size, brought into focus by time and velocity. There is a moment before impact that is the last instant of things as they are. Then the visible world explodes.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Worse than the Devil: Anarchists, Clarence Darrow, and Justice in a Time of Terror</h2><p>In 1917 a bomb exploded in a Milwaukee police station, killing nine officers and a civilian. Those responsible never were apprehended, but police, press, and public all assumed that the perpetrators were Italian. Days later, eleven alleged Italian anarchists went to trial on unrelated charges involving a fracas that had occurred two months before. Against the backdrop of World War I, and amidst a prevailing hatred and fear of radical immigrants, the Italians had an unfair trial. The specter of the larger, uncharged crime of the bombing haunted the proceedings and assured convictions of all eleven. Although Clarence Darrow led an appeal that gained freedom for most of the convicted, the celebrated lawyer's methods themselves were deeply suspect. The entire case left a dark, if hidden, stain on American justice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Largely overlooked for almost a century, the compelling story of this case emerges vividly in this meticulously researched book by Dean A. Strang. In its focus on a moment when patriotism, nativism, and terror swept the nation, <i>Worse than the Devil</i> exposes broad concerns that persist even today as the United States continues to struggle with administering criminal justice to newcomers and outsiders.</p><p>Dean A.

And along the way, the author provides vivid portraits of Clarence Darrow and Emma Goldman.&#x201d;&#x2014;Matthew Rothschild, editor of <i>The Progressive</i><br><br>&#x201c;In engaging prose and with a terrific eye for detail, Strang gives us the full story of a fascinating&#x2014;and almost forgotten&#x2014;moment of conflict from Milwaukee's past. His book explores debates over civil liberties and terrorism, immigration and radicalism as they were lived and fought over a century ago.&#x201d;&#x2014;Beverly Gage, author of <i>The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror</i><br><br>&#x201c;Strang paints a convincing and critical picture of the events in question, illuminating this moment in American history and justice. . . .

Beginning with a detailed discussion of tools and practices used in patternmaking, the text proceeds to the drafting of various blocks, which are then used to develop fashion patterns. The information in the book, though intended to be used for making patterns from scratch, will be useful for sewers who wish to modify commercial patterns, as well. From basic garment silhouettes to details like pockets, collars, and complex shaping seams, all aspects of flat-pattern design are explained. </p> --Threads Magazine<br><br><p> Book review by ASG Member, Connie Shaw </p> <p> This weighty tome is invaluable to home sewers who want to draft or change their own patterns. Written for use in fashion education classes for people pursuing careers in the garment industry, the book s introduction depicts perfectly the main goal for the publication: "Its strength lies in its clear presentation of the principles, theories, and skills of patternmaking. " </p> <p> Readers will learn about creating pattern blocks and slopers, how to apply basic styling steps, ways to correct problems in basic pattern drafts when made into slopers, the reasons why and how patterns should be balanced, and a myriad of principles all relating to flat pattern design. For me, the most outstanding aspect on Connie Crawford s book is her excellent step-by-step procedures for drafting the basic blocks. The language is clear, easy to understand, and the line drawings illustrate the clarity of her how-to explanations. I first used her basic pant draft for myself and learned the value of accuracy and making lines perfectly squared-off when I had to re-do my draft a second time! When assisting some 14 Guild members draft their patterns by Crawford s instructions, for the most part I found them easy to follow. </p> <p> A most-welcome segment contains step-by-step instructions for making a custom dress form out of papier mache, including drawings and photos, as well as how to construct a stand for the form. Whodathunk it! </p> <p> I am familiar with several popular texts used in fashion design classrooms over past years (although Crawford s book is replacing some of them) and have found most of them to be very intimidating. By contrast, the Crawford book is user-friendly. I m delighted to own it. </p> --Tucson ASG</p><h2>George Orwell: A Life</h2><p>The first and only authorized biography of George Orwell, written with the cooperation of Orwell&#39;s widow, relates the private facts of the political writer&#39;s life to the substance of his writing</p><p></p><h2>Daniel: A Novel</h2><p>Henning Mankell is a worldwide phenomenon: his books have been translated into forty languages with more than 35 million copies in print, and both his critical acclaim and fan base only continue to grow. His new novel <i>Daniel</i> is an elegiac, unexpected story that only he could have told.<br><br>In the 1870s, Hans Bengler arrives in Cape Town from Sm�land, Sweden, driven by a singular desire: to discover an insect no one has seen before and name it after himself. But then he impulsively adopts a young San orphan, a boy he christens Daniel and brings with him back to Sweden&#x2014;a quite different specimen than he first contemplated. Daniel is told to call Bengler "Father," taught to knock on doors and bow, and continually struggles to understand this strange new land of mud and snow that surrounds and seemingly entraps him. At the same time, he is haunted by visions of his murdered parents calling him home to Africa. Knowing that the only way home is by sea, he decides he must learn to walk on water if he is ever to reclaim his true place in the world.<br><br>Evocative and sometimes brutal, the novel takes Daniel through a series of tragedies and betrayals that culminate in a shocking act. Mankell tells this indelible story with a ruthless elegance all his own.</p><p>Henning Mankell is internationally Sweden's most read author. His critically acclaimed Kurt Wallander mysteries are global bestsellers and have been adapted for television as <i>Wallander</i>, the BAFTA Award&#x2013;winning BBC series starring Kenneth Branagh. He was awarded the Crime Writers' Association's Macallan Gold Dagger and the German Tolerance Prize and has been a three-time finalist for the Los Angeles Times Mystery/Thriller Book Prize. In 2008, he received an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews. Born in Stockholm in 1948 and raised in a village in northern Sweden, Mankell divides his time between Sweden and Maputo, Mozambique, where he has worked as the director of Teatro Avenida since 1985. Please visit www.henningmankell.com for more information.<br><br>Steven T. Murray has translated five novels by Henning Mankell, among many other books. The former editor-in-chief of Fjord Press, he lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Set in the 1870s, this earnest and heartbreaking story opens with the unsolved murder of a mentally retarded Swedish girl, but this isn't a mystery in the mode of Mankell's international bestselling Kurt Wallander novels (Firewall, etc.). Hans Bengler, a Swedish entomologist, travels across southern Africa in search of undiscovered insects. In the desert, he finds an orphaned native boy, whom he adopts on impulse and calls Daniel. Bengler brings Daniel back to Sweden to exhibit him for money. A link eventually emerges between the girl's murder and Daniel's story, which dramatically illuminates the evils of colonialism (Bengler notes that he "had to make the important decisions for these black people") and the cultural chasm between Europeans and Africans. Mankell fully understands Daniel's radically different cultural perspective and indelibly captures the boy's longing to return to his homeland and the tragic consequences of his forced exile. (Nov.)

My thanks to Michael and Jane and everyone at Brilliance Audio." &#x2014;Steven Erikson, Victoria, B.C. Canada, January, 2014</p><p>The sixth volume in Steven Erikson's truly epic fantasy sequence, The Malazan Book of the Fallen. <br>There's nothing like sweeping up tag-ends to change the world. The Seven Cities Rebellion has been crushed. Sha'ik slain by Tavore, the Malazan forces pacifying city after city on the troubled subcontinent, and one last rebel army, under the reluctant, embittered command of Leoman of the Flails, is pursued to the ancient and infamous city of Y'Ghatan by Tavore and the Fourteenth Army. Dogged by self-doubt and ill omens, the 14th must lay siege to the city, and Adjunct Tavore must seek to outwit Leoman of the Flails, the deadliest foe she has ever faced. <br>Into this fraught scenario come both new and familiar characters. Among the latter, Heboric Ghost Hands, journeying to redress an old wrong. Apsalar, haunted by possession and now the principal agent of Cotillion, Patron of Assassins, marking a trail with blood and dripping daggers. Cutter, the killer who had once been a thief in Darujhistan, fleeing a shattered heart. Karsa Orlong, a warrior hunting his destiny. And two old friends, traveling companions, Mappo and Icarium, wandering once more the ravaged wastelands, Icarium seeking the ancient truths of his own life, Mappo seeking to keep those truths from him, at all costs. <br>All, searching for such fates as they might fashion with their own hands, guided by their own will. If only the gods would leave them alone. Alas, the gods are disinclined to be kind, now that knives have been unsheathed, and there shall be war, war in the heavens. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>Steven Erikson is an anthropologist and archaeologist and a graduate of the Iowa Writer&#x2019;s Workshop.

Rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity&#39;s many denominations, C.S. Lewis provides an opportunity for believers and non-believers alike to hear a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.</p><p>In 1943 Great Britain, when hope and the moral fabric of society were threatened by the relentless inhumanity of global war, an Oxford don was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. Over half a century after the original lectures, the topic retains it urgency. Expanded into book form, <i>Mere Christianity</i> never flinches as it sets out a rational basis for Christianity and builds an edifice of compassionate morality atop this foundation. As Mr. Lewis clearly demonstrates, Christianity is not a religion of flitting angels and blind faith, but of free will, an innate sense of justice and the grace of God.<p>In 1941 England, when all hope was threatened by the inhumanity of war, C. S. Lewis was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. More than half a century later, these talks continue to retain their poignancy. First heard as informal radio broadcasts on the BBC, the lectures were published as three books and subsequently combined as <em>Mere Christianity</em>. C. S. Lewis proves that "at the center of each there is something, or a Someone, who against all divergences of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks with the same voice," rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity's many denominations. This twentieth century masterpiece provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.</p><p>With a new foreword by Lewis's stepson, Douglas Gresham, this illustrated gift edition evokes the historic time and place of the book's creation.</p></p><h2>The Politics of Motherhood: Activist Voices from Left to Right</h2><p>Perhaps the most deeply rooted stereotype of motherhood, editor Annelise Orleck writes, is "the notion that mothers are by definition apolitical, isolated with their children in a world of pure emotion, far removed from the welter of politics and social struggle." This collection of essays, interviews, and personal narratives challenges the image of a mutually absorbed madonna and child and explodes the myth that bearing and raising children alters a woman's consciousness in some fundamentally conservative way, silencing her voice and disarming her rebellion.<br><br>Instead, these contributors demonstrate that motherhood often redefines and revitalizes a woman's political consciousness. From Love Canal to the Kenyan countryside, from a public housing project in Las Vegas to a plaza in Buenos Aires, from a Minnesota Indian reservation to the Gaza Strip, the radicalizing events differ but the effects are the same. While most mothers from disparate classes, races, nationalities, cultures, and political ideologies mobilize to protect their children from toxic waste, war, racism, or political persecution, some such as KKK mothers fight to maintain hateful stereotypes that put others at risk. By examining the characteristics, effects, contradictions, and prices of "motherist" politics, we can begin to understand the forces that bring these women out from behind their curtains.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 1 illus.

Our perspectives narrowed by hindsight, the world of that year is reduced to its most frivolous features-last summers in grand aristocratic residences-or its most destructive ones: the unresolved rivalries of the great European powers, the fear of revolution, violence in the Balkans.<br><br>In this illuminating history, Charles Emmerson liberates the world of 1913 from this "prelude to war" narrative, and explores it as it was, in all its richness and complexity. Traveling from Europe's capitals, then at the height of their global reach, to the emerging metropolises of Canada and the United States, the imperial cities of Asia and Africa, and the boomtowns of Australia and South America, he provides a panoramic view of a world crackling with possibilities, its future still undecided, its outlook still open.<br><br>Full of fascinating characters, stories, and insights, <i>1913: In Search of the World before the Great War</i> brings a lost world vividly back to life, with provocative implications for how we understand our past and how we think about our future. <br></p><p><b>Charles Emmerson</b> is a Senior Research Fellow at Chatham House working on resource security, foreign policy, and global geopolitics. He is the author of The Future History of the Arctic and 1913: In Search of the World Before the Great War. He was formerly a writer for the Financial Times and continues to publish regularly on international affairs. He lives in London, England."Emmerson draws upon an impressive range of contemporary source material, ranging from travel guides and memoirs to unpublished diaries, newspaper reports and diplomatic memos. They give a vivid portrait of the rapid changes occurring in daily life around the globe. Charles Emmerson captures all the world's hope and excitement as it experienced an economic El Dorado. <i>1913 </i>is history without hindsight at its best."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Wall Street Journal</i></i></b><br><br>"In each city the author vividly surveys the political, economic and cultural scenes. The effect is transporting; <i>1913 </i>is both passport and time machine. The centenary of the Great War will no doubt see the publication of many fine histories of the conflict, but few are likely to paint so alluring a portrait of the world that was consumed by it-and that helped bring it about."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br>"With the looming 100th anniversary of World War I, a spate of books about the not-so-Great War have begun to emerge. Emmerson's effort stands out for several reasons. First, Emmerson ranges widely, from Germany to Paris, from Bombay to Tokyo. Second, he is a sparkling writer, his narrative rarely flags and he has amassed a startling amount of detail."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Daily Beast</i></i></b><br><br>"[Emmerson] aims not to explain what caused or was lost to the war, but to retrieve from the partial glare of hindsight the world in which it erupted. This is no modest undertaking. Mr. Emmerson draws from a wide range of sources, including memoirs, billboards and newspapers, to recreate a year that was fairly uneventful. Not unlike Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time," the first instalments of which were published in 1913, his narrative finds coherence in the unremarkable. [W]hat emerges is a rich portrait and an important set of ideas."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Economist</i></i></b><br><br>"Emmerson offers an impressive sweep that marshals much detail along the way, though at times there is a sense of being on a historical package tour (Baedeker is, indeed, a frequently cited source) in which some city breaks are better rendered than others. But there are some gems. In the patchwork Austro-Hungarian empire, one could drive on both sides of the road and there were 10 official languages but no translators in parliament. Does anyone wonder that it fell apart?"&#x2015;<b><i><i>Financial Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Marvelous. Emmerson, a scholar at Chatham House, a renowned London think tank, brilliantly avoids the inevitability trap in <i>1913</i>. His panoramic depiction of the last year before the Great War permits us to see the world as it might have looked through contemporary eyes, in its full colour and complexity, with a sense of the future's openness. Emmerson is a superb guide and companion, whether inviting us to take a seat next to him in a favourite corner of a Viennese cafe or to survey tout Paris from the Eiffel Tower. In many ways, his book works as a time-travelogue--indeed, it frequently quotes contemporary tourist literature and travelers' accounts."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></i></b><br><br>"An eye-opening demonstration of just how modern the supposedly premodern world was."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Maclean's</i></i></b><br><br>"The book reveals a world both different from today's world, yet still familiar in many ways. It captures the year of 1913 in a way that is fascinating and revealing."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Galveston Daily News</i></i></b><br><br>"Portraying the European capitals of the next year's belligerent countries, Emmerson strikes a cosmopolitan tone by noting social interconnections linking London to Paris to Berlin to Constantinople. Including stops in Tehran, Mexico City, Jerusalem, several U.S. cities, Shanghai, and Tokyo, Emmerson's historical world tour emotively captures the civilization soon to vanish in WWI."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"Emmerson's project would not be as compelling if he had simply focused on Europe, or on England and her colonies. The Great War was truly a global war, and the world of 1913 was truly a global society. In his book, Emmerson gives fair weight to societies around the world rather than presenting the year from a Eurocentric point of view."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></i></b></p><h2>The Snow Goose</h2><p>Against the backdrop of World War II, friendship develops between a lonely crippled painter and a village girl, when together they minister to an injured snow goose.</p><p>A curious story involving not only the Snow Goose, the Canada-bred wanderer of the airways, but also a couple and their travels.

Indeed, <i>The Sunday Times</i> described her letters as "wonderful . . . brimful of liveliness and irreverence, steeliness and sweetness."</p><p>Now, in <i>Counting One's Blessings</i>, Shawcross has put together a selection of her letters, drawing on the vast wealth of material in the Royal Archives and at Glamis Castle.

Authorities quickly arrest the infant&#39;s teenage parents, charging them with murder. Did Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson, in fact, murder their own baby? Tammy Wynette died suddenly at a relatively young age, and yet no autopsy was performed? Was someone trying to hide the real cause of death? Did Sam Sheppard (later dubbed &#34;The Fugitive&#34; based on a television series) really kill his wife? And if not, who committed the murder?Things are not always as they appear, as world-renowned forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht shows in this riveting behind-the-scenes look at nine famous cases. In the nationally known baby case involving Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson, Dr. Wecht reviews the evidence and comes to a startling conclusion. In fascinating detail, he demonstrates how the tools of forensic pathology often uncover murky, long-hidden secrets that crack seemingly unsolvable crimes. Writing in the first-person Dr. Wecht leads you into the heart of the investigation, focusing each chapter on a single engrossing drama. He reveals the most startling evidence that shows why JonBenet Ramsey&#39;s killer most likely came from within her home, why O.J. Simpson probably had an accomplice in the murder of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman, shocking revelations about Robert Berdella&#39;s grisly torture and sex-abuse crimes against young men, and many intriguing facts about other infamous cases.If you find the fictional plots of such dramas as C.S.I. exciting, you will be amazed by the true stories told by Dr. Wecht, with the help of two top-flight veteran reporters, Greg Saitz and Mark Curriden, in this amazing real-life thriller. As this intriguing page-turner proves, the science of forensic pathology has changed the face of detective work forever.From the Trade Paperback edition.</p><p>Cyril H. Wecht, M.D., J.D. (Pittsburgh, PA), one of the world's leading pathologists, is the author of Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey?, Grave Secrets, Cause of Death, and hundreds of professional publications. He has served as president of both the American College of Legal Medicine and the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, and has appeared on numerous nationally syndicated television programs including NBC's Dateline, Larry King Live, 20/20, Burden of Proof, and many others.<br>Greg Saitz (Parsippany, NJ), for many years a crime and court reporter for The (Newark) Star Ledger, now works on the business desk.<br>Mark Curriden (Dallas, TX) is the lawyer-media strategist for Vinson &amp; Elkins, LLP, and the former legal writer for The Dallas Morning News and The Atlanta Constitution. &gt;.In this review of nine of his cases, pathologist Wecht gives readers a glimpse into the dark secrets that only the police, lawyers and criminals know about some of America's most intriguing murder cases in recent memory. The prose is crisp, and Wecht, writing with crime reporter Saitz and legal writer Curriden, does an admirable job of explaining technical procedures and scientific evidence in layman's terms. While Wecht's forensic expertise helps shed some light on what really happened in this collection of solved and unsolved cases, the book as a whole points out that forensics is not an infallible method for determining who committed a certain crime. For instance, Wecht's review of the Grossberg and Peterson case (two college freshmen accused of murdering their baby in 1996), on which he consulted for Grossberg's defense, demonstrates the different conclusions that doctors can reach from studying the same autopsies. Furthermore, in two of the high-profile stories mentioned in the book, the O.J. Simpson and JonBenet Ramsey cases, the limitations of forensic science are exposed. Having viewed autopsy records in both cases, Wecht does have compelling theories about who committed these headline-making crimes, but his educated guesses are not proof enough to put anyone behind bars. Still, while some of the cases in this volume are still unsolved, the inherent life-and-death dramatics in each of Wecht's reviews will certainly catch the eye of those who like a good murder mystery or fancy themselves armchair detectives. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cult Movies 3: 50 More of the Classics, the Sleepers, the Weird and the Wonderful</h2><p>Gives plot summaries, cast, credits, and commentary for fifty horror, science fiction, gangster, western, musical, comedy, and foreign films that have a special following of fans</p><p>YA-- Another in a popular and readable series.

Each of the ten chapters opens with a brief introduction, followed by illustrations presenting the key ideas about drawing the figure. Through studying these drawings, and honing your own skills through practice, you'll learn how to:</p><ul><li>Capture the dynamic action of the figure</li><li>Render the figure in light and shade</li><li>Proportion the figure so it has dignity and grace</li><li>Draw the masses and forms of the figure accurately</li></ul></p><p><p>YA-- An excellent choice to supplement life-drawing instruction in the classroom. Technical information on anatomy, proportion, lighting, weight distribution, and foreshortening is discussed. Beyond this, however, Sheppard shows how to render various figure types and how to capture the figure in motion. The use of a variety of media gives the book an added dimension. Two hundred drawings done in a classical style illustrate the points. They are often accompanied by diagrams to explain the underlying form. The text is informative and written in a way that gives the feeling of having an instructor at hand.</p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Somatic Reality</h2><p>Transitions -- crises, changes, and turning points -- are part of each human life and they include bodily transitions and experience.

It turns lies told by politicians into &#34;strategic misrepresentations&#34; or &#34;reality augmentation,&#34; and ordinary sewage sludge into &#34;regulated organic nutrients&#34; that doesn&#39;t stink but merely &#34;exceeds the odor threshold.&#34; In this pithy sequel to his bestselling Doublespeak, Lutz exposes the latest prevarications that permeate our public discourse, dissecting how they work, and showing how they affect us as individuals and as a nation. Most important, he shows how to demand clear communication, become critical consumers of language, and fight doublespeak in our homes, schools, workplaces, and the political arena.</p><p>William Lutz, a professor of English at Rutgers University and former editor of the Quarterly Review of Doublespeak, has had enough of doublespeak--the inflated, involved and often deliberately ambiguous use of language or when &#34;strategic misinterpretations&#34; are used instead of lies. He argues that the practice has been growing in our culture, and he&#39;s right. In this book he reviews doubletalk by Democrats, Republicans, journalists, economists and Supreme Court justices, and shows how the repeated use of a phrase allows it to stay unchallenged in the lexicon. Say what you mean, argues Lutz, and we&#39;ll all be better off.William Lutz was the head of the Committee on Public Doublespeak for 15 years, and editor of the <i>Quarterly Review of Doublespeak</i> for 14 years. He is professor of English at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, and a member of the Pennsylvania Bar. <p>His previous books include <i>Doublespeak: From Revenue Enhancement to Terminal Living</i> and <i>The Cambridge Thesaurus of American English</i>.

She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes a National Book Award for poetry for Tonight, No Poetry Will Serve, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant in 1994, and a National Book Award for poetry in 1974 for Diving Into the Wreck. That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s other volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2006, Rich was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.&#x201c;In this collection, Ms. Rich has shown both a deep knowledge of her subject, women, and a fine mastery of her craft, timeless contemporary poetry. Above all, she has not abandoned the struggle of 'trying to live/in a clear-headed tenderness' and translating her efforts into critical signposts for those who follow.&#x201d; &#x2014; Kansas City Star</p><h2>Life of Fred Language Arts Series: Begin Teaching</h2><p>The second book of the Life of Fred Language Arts Series.

Simultaneously, in small-town Maryland, the sons of a Pullman Porter--gifted six-year-old Eliot and his artistic twelve-year-old brother Dwight--grow up navigating a world expanded both by a visit from civil and labor rights activist A. Philip Randolph and by the legacy of a lynched great-aunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The four mature into men, directly confronting the fierce resistance to the early civil rights movement, and are all ultimately uprooted. Corthron's ear for dialogue, honed from years of theater work, brings to life all the major concerns and movements of America's past century through the organic growth of her marginalized characters, and embraces a quiet beauty in their everyday existences.&nbsp;<br><br>Sharing a cultural and literary heritage with the work of Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, and Edward P. Jones, Kia Corthron's <i>The Castle Cross the Magnet Carter</i> is a monumental epic deftly bridging the political and the poetic, and wrought by one of America's most recently recognized treasures.</p><p>The author of more than fifteen plays produced nationally and internationally, <b>KIA CORTHRON</b> came to national attention in the early nineties with her play <i>Come Down Burning</i>. Portraying characters who live in extreme poverty or crisis and whose lives are otherwise invisible, her plays paint a disturbing picture of American history and its repercussions on our most intimate relationships. Corthron's most recent awards include a Windham Campbell Prize for Drama, the Simon Great Plains Playwright (Honored Playwright) Award, the USA Jane Addams Fellowship Award, and the Lee Reynolds Award from the League of Professional Theatre Women, and she has developed work through various international residencies. She has also written for television, receiving a Writers Guild Outstanding Drama Series Award and an Edgar Award for <i>The Wire</i>. <i>The Castle Cross the Magnet Carter</i> is her first novel. She grew up in Cumberland, Maryland, and now lives in Harlem, New York."<i>The Castle Cross the Magnet Carter</i> is a stunning novel. Kia Corthron plunges us into generations of American history, moving with force and subtlety through the charged realities of race, gender and region. It is a novel of ideas and politics, of psychological complexity and of vibrant, kinetic language." --<b>Margo Jefferson</b>, <i>Negroland</i><br><br>"Big, ambitious, challenging ... It tells the 20th-century history of the United States through the intersecting lives of two white brothers and two black brothers. It is, by turns, tender, brutal and redemptive." --<b>Viet Thanh Nguyen</b>, Pulitzer Prize winning author of <i>The Sympathizer</i> in a Q&amp;A in the New York Times Book Review<br><br>"There are whole chunks of writing here that are simply sublime, places in which one gets swept away by the way she subverts the rhythm of language to illuminate the familiar and allow it to be seen fresh. ... &nbsp;[Corthron] blindsides you. &nbsp;She sneaks up from behind. &nbsp;Sometimes, it is with moments of humor, but more often with moments of raw emotional power -- moments whose pathos feels hard-earned and true.... [The Castle Cross the Magnet Carter] succeeds admirably in a novel's first and most difficult task: It makes you give a damn. &nbsp;It also does well by a novel's second task: It sends you away pondering what it has to say."<b>--Leonard Fitts Jr., The New York Times Book Review (Editor's Choice)</b><br><br>"Kia Corthron&#x2019;s first novel is a stunning achievement by any measure&#x2014;a riveting saga of two twentieth-century American families trapped inside the quotidian contradictions and compulsions of race, disability, and sexuality.&nbsp; The untidiness of history is conveyed through experiences, dreams, and inevitable eruptions of violence, yet also unexpected patterns of escape and possible orbits of justice."&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Angela Y. Davis, UC Santa Cruz<br><br></b>"When I first read it, I was stunned. It's a haunting and devastating tale, leavened with humor and hope ... I believe [<i>The Castle Cross the Magnet Carter</i>] is the most important piece of writing about twentieth-century America since James Baldwin's&nbsp;<i>Another Country</i>." &#x2014;playwright <b>Naomi Wallace</b> quoted in <i>Elle </i>magazine<b><br></b><br><br>"Kia Corthron has written a magnificent, truly epic tale of the American Century told through the lives of two families, four brothers, three generations, big movements and small moments. It deserves a place among the great American novels precisely because it cuts to the very heart of America: the color line. In vivid, often breathtaking language, she reveals a changing world where love and sex and violence can rain down in the same cloudburst, and laughter and terror mingle easily, where the color line is not merely a barrier but a jump rope, a noose, a sign, and above all a tether that binds her characters and this country together." &nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Robin&nbsp;D. G.&nbsp;Kelley</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</i>&nbsp;(2009)<br><br>&#x201c;In the tradition of Toni Morrison, Alex Haley and Alice Walker, she makes the personal political, creating an epic portrayal of race in America.&#x201d;--<b>Ms.</b> magazine<br>"Playwright Corthron's big, open-hearted debut novel has echoes of noted writers from the mid-20th century, which serves as its backdrop: the social conscience of Steinbeck, the epic sweep of Ferber, the narrative quirks of Dos Passos. Reading Corthron's novel adds racial context to the classic works of these earlier writers. The story follows two pairs of brothers: white Randall and B.J., who grow up in rural Alabama; and black Eliot and Dwight, who grow up in small-town Maryland. For all its size, this is a modestly plotted quartet of coming-of-age stories. It begins in 1941, with studious teenage Randall sharing his love of literature and his family history. B.J., who is five years his elder, is deaf, and Randall has become his de facto caretaker. Brilliant Eliot, who's all of six years old, and hard-working Dwight, who's 12, narrate the parallel storyline in counterpointed first-person chapters. Eliot's rackety prose plays nicely off Dwight's crisp, dutiful sentences. The story moves to the late '50s, with all four young men growing up in the thick of the Civil Rights movement. Randall's ambition and B.J.'s condition necessitate a separation, with Randall moving to New York. Eliot goes to law school and Dwight gets a sensible job as a postman. The story then moves to 1993; Eliot and Randall cross paths, as readers suspect they must, and there are consequences for both. Corthron jumps to 2010 for a lengthy epilogue. This huge novel has the intimacy of memoir; Corthron's narrative voice makes it easy for readers to immerse themselves in the book, rarely coming up for air.

Miles Ahead. Brubeck Time. Yardbird Suite. The Sidewinder</i>. For newcomers just beginning their library of recordings, and for longtime fans looking to deepen their understanding, <i>New York Times</i> jazz critic Ben Ratliff offers an assertive, deeply knowledgeable collector's guide, full of opinions and insights on the one hundred greatest recorded works of jazz. <br><br>From the rare early recordings of Louis Armstrong, through Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman's seminal Carnegie Hall concert, and the lions of the bebop era, to the transformative Miles Davis and several less-canonized artists, such as Chano Pozo, Jimmy Giuffre, and Greg Osby, who have made equally significant contributions, Ratliff places each recording in the greater context and explains its importance in the development of the form. Taken together, these original essays add up to a brief history of jazz, highlighting milestone events, legendary players, critical trends, and artistic breakthroughs.<br></p><p>Ben Ratliff is the jazz critic at <i>The New York Times</i>. He lives in Manhattan with his wife and two sons.<br>Ratliff, a music critic for the New York Times, presents essays on what he considers the 100 most important jazz recordings. In each, he discusses a recording's merits and shortcomings and includes a list of its performers. He seems to address the younger or potential jazz fan; otherwise, how could one explain his comparisons of mid-20th century jazz performances to those of Nirvana and Sonic Youth? Straight and to the point, Ratliff acts as an advocate for what he sees as a popular art form in need of an infusion of interest. This informative book is heavy on obvious albums by Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, and Charlie Parker, but the inclusion of Jeanne Lee, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys, "Baby Face" Willette, and present-day phenomenon Jason Moran illustrates Ratliff's catholic view of the jazz genre. Also included is a list (title, main performer, date, and record label information only) of a second 100 recordings. This might not be a book that jazz fans will buy for their personal libraries-they have probably already formed their own tastes and list of favorites-but as a guide for the uninitiated it is essential for academic music libraries and public libraries large and small. It would also be most useful for collection development librarians building a well-rounded jazz CD collection.<br><i>James E. Perone, Mt.

He is also the literary executor of Mickey Spillane.Fans of Collins (<i>Road to Perdition</i>) will be delighted to find him resurrecting Quarry, the ruthless hit-man he put to rest years ago, after six Quarry novels and a small handful of short stories. Now living and relaxing in the Minnesota woods, Quarry is lured out of retirement by a Chicago media magnate who wants a seemingly harmless young librarian dead. But when he winds up falling for his target, one Janet Wright, Quarry begins second-guessing his assignment and experiences an uncharacteristic change of heart that almost gets him killed. Stemming from Collins's screenplay for the award-winning short film <i>A Matter of Principal</i>, this novel covers a lot of ground in a small space&#x2014;a credit to the distinct, wry voice Collins has given Quarry, who doesn't waste anything, least of all words: "Louis cracked open the door and peered out and said, 'What is it?' and I shot him in the eye." Compact enough to be read in a couple of sittings but bristling with suspense and sexuality, this book is a welcome addition to the Hard Crime Case library and, if there's any justice, will spark sales of Collins's back-catalogue titles. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Building on the critical and commercial success of <strong>Hope to Die</strong>, Block puts Scudder -- and the reader -- at the very edge of the abyss.</p><p>Scudder, a complex character who has grown and aged in real time, confronts the implacable challenge of mortality. But he must also tackle a determined, relentless, and icily inhuman adversary, perhaps the most unforgettable villain Block has ever created.</p><p>A man in a Virginia prison awaits execution for three hideous murders he swears, in the face of irrefutable evidence, he did not commit. A psychologist who claims to believe the convict spends hours with the man in his death row cell, and ultimately watches in the gallery as the lethal injection is administered. His work completed, the psychologist heads back to New York City to attend to unfinished business.</p><p>Meanwhile, Scudder has just agreed to investigate the ostensibly suspicious online lover of an acquaintance. It seems simple enough. At first. But when people start dying and the victims are increasingly closer to home, it becomes clear that a vicious killer is at work. And the final targets may be Matt and Elaine Scudder.</p><p>The suspense is breathtaking, the outcome never certain. A series that has garnered no end of awards -- the Edgar, the Shamus, the Philip Marlowe, the MalteseFalcon -- has ascended to a dizzying new height. With this novel, Lawrence Block, who recently received the Diamond Dagger for lifetime achievement from the Crime Writers Association of the United Kingdom, is at the very top of his form.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p>With a title taken from the ballad "Danny Boy," Lawrence Block's sixteenth novel to feature Matthew Scudder is his darkest in years. When a woman he meets at an AA meeting asks him to check the background of her new boyfriend, Scudder finds his path crossed with that of a brilliant serial killer who changes his methods at will and leaves virtually no trace of his identity. Alan Sklar reads the novel with his customary professional precision. It isn't only his baritone vibrato that helps maintain Block's dark mood, but the way in which timing, pacing, and the subtlest vocal nuances define the characters as he narrates Scudder's close and unforgettable brush with evil.

The school, with all of its activity, faded from Eve's view. </p> <p> The girl was all she could see. A girl she knew. </p> <p> But it wasn't possible! Not here! </p> <p> Eve's heart crashed, and the familiar rhythm of life resumed. She was mistaken. No matter how the girl resembled . . . </p> <p> The girl still stood on the grass, unmoving. The other students swarmed by, but this one lost child, an outcast, shut off from the busy world around her, was immobilized by her own insignificance. </p> <p> A knot of empathy rose in Eve's throat. </p> <p> She'd come to deliver flowers, but she decided then that she would deliver something more. </p> <p> So very, very much more. </p> <p>-----</p> <p>MARCI STOOD on numb legs, unable to move. It wasn't that she didn't have the strength to walk across the schoolyard and up those wide, sweeping steps that led into the gaping double doors. It was that she didn't want to walk past the other students. </p> <p> But school was out, and she had to get to her locker, simple as that. Which meant she had to pass by <em>them</em>. </p> <p> She'd long ago stopped thinking of them by name. It wasn't Kevin, the quarterback who led his fans around campus, or Cheryl, his girlfriend, who had an annoying habit of popping her gum, or Tom, who had that loud motorcycle they called an Indian. It was just <em>them</em>. </p> <p> There were twenty-nine kids in the eleventh grade. Twenty-eight of <em>them</em> were going to Kevin's fall party tonight. One was not. It didn't take a rocket scientist to know which one. </p> <p> The one with the long, stringy brown hair. The one who had fat fingers and stubby nails. The one who tried to cover her zits with makeup but failed miserably. The one who wore Salvation Army rejects because she couldn't afford real clothes from Rich's department stores. </p> <p> Marci stood still, knowing that even now, standing alone on the front lawn, she stuck out like a wart. It was Friday. School was out. She couldn't just stand here forever. </p> <p> Marci lowered her eyes to the grass and forced herself forward. Her red plaid kick-pleat skirt hung around her knees. She'd saved up for three months and bought it a week ago, but she hadn't worked up the courage to wear it until today. A stupid, stupid, stupid thing to do. What was she thinking? She hated herself for feeling like she had to wear it to fit in. </p> <p> Three girls were walking by, looking at her. </p> <p> "Nice skirt," one of them said. </p> <p> Marci's face flushed. She should have gone home. </p> <p> "Stunning," the second said. </p> <p> "You wearing that dress tonight?" </p> <p> Marci's vision clouded with embarrassment. All of them knew she hadn't been invited. </p> <p> "Never too late to impress the boys," the third said, winking. </p> <p> "Please, she isn't even going. And if she showed up in that, we'd have to lock her in the bathroom to keep the boys from throwing up." The girl skipped ahead. "Come on! Bobby's waiting." </p> <p> Marci's world spun. Funny how it never got easier. She walked forward. The steps had emptied. She climbed them a step at a time, hating every swish of her skirt. </p> <p> The building had emptied too. She turned down the long hall and walked quickly, scuffed shoes clicking on the concrete floor. She reached her locker. Pulled it open and stared in. </p> <p> Her diary sat on her upper shelf. She stared at it dumbly. The words she'd written just a week ago ran through her mind. <em>I'm pretty sure I have enough money for at least a new skirt, the one in the window at Lerners. Maybe a new blouse too! I'm going to do it! I'm going down to pick out a skirt that all the others would wish they had bought. Then I'm going to wear it to school.</em></p> <p> Marci reached for the diary, pulled it out. Maybe she should take the book home and burn it. </p> <p> Someone was in the hall to her left. A shadow in the corner of Marci's eye. She turned her head. </p> <p> A woman with gray hair, wearing a yellow-flowered dress, stood alone in the hall twenty yards away, looking directly at her. A vase of roses sat on a cabinet next to the woman. </p> <p> Normally Marci would have looked away, but for some reason she couldn't. She just looked back into the woman's long, haunting stare. </p> <p> They seemed to be trapped in each other's eyes. The air suddenly felt too thick to breathe. Still the woman wouldn't break off the stare. Marci didn't know what to do. </p> <p> The woman was suddenly walking down the hall. Straight for her. Eyes locked. </p> <p> A small wave of dread swept through Marci's chest. The woman stopped five feet away. There was something about the woman's eyes. Pity. Maybe horror. But that wasn't it. There was more. </p> <p> Something surreal. Something impossible. </p> <p> "What's your name, child?" </p> <p> The woman's voice was soft and low with a foreign accent. </p> <p> "I'm not here to hurt you," the woman said. "You may call me Eve. What is your name?" </p> <p> "Marci." </p> <p> "Hello, Marci." The woman blinked. "You hate yourself because you don't think you're beautiful, is that it?" </p> <p> At first the question sounded distant. How did the old woman know that? Was it so obvious? Then again, people always assumed that ugly people hated themselves. Though for Marci, it was true. </p> <p> "Do you believe everything can change in the space of one breath, Marci?" the woman asked. </p> <p> Marci stood frozen. </p> <p> The woman slipped a card from her purse. "You think physical beauty is important? Fine. I'll work in your world, for your sake. Come to my flower shop tomorrow, and I will make you beautiful." </p> <p> Marci's thoughts collided. Now that she thought about it, the woman was saying that she really <em>was</em> ugly. Of course she was ugly; everyone knew that, but not so ugly a stranger would walk up to her and make a point of it. </p> <p> The woman stepped forward and slid the card under the diary's cover with a touch as soft as her voice. "More beautiful than you can possibly imagine," she said. Eve lifted her hand, touched Marci's chin. "And I'm not speaking of inner beauty, child. I can change the way you look with a power beyond your comprehension." </p> <p> Then the woman turned and walked down the hall. She stepped through the doors to the street and was gone. </p> <p> Marci stood by her open locker, diary in arm, staring after the woman. The first hints of real anger prompted a faint tremor in her fingers. The anger swelled to rage. How could a total stranger dare make such a cruel insult? </p> <p> How could anyone walk up to her and tell her that she really <em>was</em> ugly and needed to be changed? And how could the witch taunt her with such an absurd promise? <em>Let's dress you up and pretend you're beautiful and parade you around the block for all the boys to laugh at</em>. </p> <p> The tremble ran to Marci's heels. She clenched her hand, and for the first time that day, a tear slipped from her eye. </p> <em> I hate you</em> . <em>I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! I will cut my wrists before I come </em><em>to your pathetic little flower shop! </em></p><h2>The Giant Under the Snow</h2><p>First published in 1968, THE GIANT UNDER THE SNOW created a fascinating world of magic, ancient evil and curses long before Harry Potter and His Dark Materials.

In herbest-selling books, scholar Elaine Pagels has explored some of the ancient Christian writings that were excluded from the New Testament. Now, for the first time, L. Michael White, one of the world's foremost scholars on the origins of Christianity, provides the complete, astonishing story of how Christianity grew from the personal vision of a humble Jewish peasant living in a remote province of the Roman Empire into the largest organized religion in the world.</p><p>Many take for granted that the New Testament is a single book representing God's coherent, unwavering word on Jesus and his church. A closer reading reveals not one story, but many. The New Testament is a collection of books -- the result of a variety of influences on a number of faithful but very human visionaries, preachers, and storytellers. The texts contain a wealth of biographies, histories, novels, letters, sermons, hymns, church manuals, and apocalypses, providing a spectrum of views of Jesus, his message, and his movement.</p><p>Given this diversity of people, stories, and drastically different points of view, how did Christianity ever become what we know it as today? White draws on the most current scholarship to bring alive these ancient people and their debates, showing in depth how their stories were formed into what the world has come to know as the New Testament.</p><p>Rather than reading the New Testament straight through in its traditional order -- Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and so on -- White takes a historical approach, looking at the individual books in the sequence in which they were actually written. He explores what these books divulge about the disagreements, shared values, and unifying mission of the earliest Christian communities. White digs through layers of archaeological excavations, sifts through buried fragments of largely unknown texts, and examines historical sources to discover what we can know of Jesus and his early followers.</p><p>It is this early, hidden history that shaped Christianity as it grew from an errant, messianic movement to a state religion and then into a world religion that has lasted for over two thousand years. White shows how the early debates spurred the evolution of Christianity as we know it. He delves into the arguments over how to understand Jesus as both human and divine, the role of women in the church, the diversity of beliefs among Christian communities, the Gnostic influences, and the political disputes that raged over which books would ultimately be included in the New Testament. Complete with illustrations, photos, charts, and maps, <em>From Jesus to Christianity</em> presents the fullest picture yet of the beginnings of what became the most popular religion on earth.</p></p><p><p>L. Michael White is Ronald Nelson Smith Chair in Classics and Christian Origins and the director of the Institute for the Study of Antiquity and Christian Origins at the University of Texas at Austin. He is the author of <em>From Jesus to Christianity</em> and has been featured in and co-written two award-winning PBS <em>Frontline</em> documentaries.</p>Joining an already distinguished lineup of narrators of early Christianity that includes Bart Ehrman, John Dominic Crossan and Gregory Riley, White contributes this rather predictable and pedantic story of the ways in which early Christianity developed its religious identity and its literature (the New Testament). White, who teaches Christian origins at the University of Texas at Austin and who co-wrote the PBS special <i>From Jesus to Christ</i>, chronicles the evolution of early Christianity as a family history. The first "generation" (30&#x2013;70 C.E.) saw the death of Jesus, the rise of Paul and the end of the Jewish revolt against Rome. In the second (70&#x2013;110 C.E.), tensions developed between the Jesus sect and Judaism, a separation that became permanent in the third generation (110&#x2013;150 C.E.), when Jesus' followers broke away from their Jewish roots and began to develop their own institutional identity and intrareligious squabbles. Finally, by the fourth generation (150&#x2013;190 C.E.), Christianity had assumed an integral role in the social and intellectual context of the Roman Empire. White uses sidebars to provide helpful summaries of the authorship, provenance, date and themes of various writings and to offer useful lists of further readings. However, his bland presentation uncovers nothing especially new in the story of early Christianity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It chronicles an almighty struggle between the author and her mother, a stubborn rabble-rouser bursting with tart, angry pronouncements, moxie, and an undeniable measure of charm. Waving away an "Eastern religionist" trying to sell her on his god, she raps out: "Young man, I am a Jew and a socialist. I think that's more than enough for one lifetime, don't you?" Her husband's untimely death is the occasion for such wild histrionics--screaming, refusing to walk, flinging herself into the grave--that when Gornick works the Middle East years later as a journalist, the ululating cries and fainting mourners at funerals seem comfortably familiar. The rapid-fire flow of confidences and furious arguments between the duo mellow slightly, believably, as they grow older together.Vivian Gornick, &#34;one of the most vital and indispensable essayists of our cultural moment&#34; (Phillip Lopate), has written for The New York Times, The Village Voice, and other journals.</p><h2>Every Street Is Paved With Gold: The Road to Real Success</h2><p>A collection of surefire strategies, proven tips, simple parables, and unique techniques from the founder and chairman of the Daewoo Group reminds Americans what it takes to achieve real success in today&#39;s business world. 50,000 first printing. $40,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: KoreanIn an optimistic life guide reminiscent of the philosophies of Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale, the founder and CEO of Seoul-based Daewoo, the world's 45th-largest industrial empire, relates how he rose from newsboy to leader of a business with international sales of $22 billion in 1991.

The second volume in this history takes the story of Britain from the Civil War to the Enlightenment. Each chapter focuses on a major theme.</p><p>Simon Schama is University Professor of Art History and History at Columbia University. His award-winning books, translated into fifteen languages, include Citizens, Landscape and Memory, Rembrandt&#39;s Eyes, A History of Britain, The Power of Art, Rough Crossings, The American Future, The Face of Britain and The Story of the Jews: Finding the Words (1000 BCE - 1492). His art columns for the New Yorker won the National Magazine Award for criticism and his journalism has appeared regularly in the Guardian and the Financial Times where he is Contributing Editor. He has written and presented more than fifty films for the BBC on subjects as diverse as Tolstoy, American politics, and The Story of the Jews and is co-presenter of a new landmark series on the history of world art, Civilisations.This book is imposing in many ways but is worth every minute. The journey through this period of British history is long, over 20 hours, and thorough, almost a year-by-year account. Narrator Stephen Thorne reads expertly. His phrasing, crystal-clear diction, and magisterial tone bring this vivid book alive, making it crackle with intrigue, war, and royal power struggles. While Thorne does not dramatize any of the characters, the author's words are robust enough that he need only concentrate on making the events clear, dramatic, and surprising--and he succeeds magnificently. History of this caliber comes along rarely. Readers should jump at the chance to indulge themselves.

Alive with tension and atmosphere and disturbingly real, this is an outstanding continuation of the Reykjav�k Murder Mysteries. <br><br>Building work in an expanding Reykjav�k uncovers a shallow grave. Years before, this part of the city was all open hills, and Erlendur and his team hope this is a typical Icelandic missing person scenario; perhaps someone once lost in the snow, who has lain peacefully buried for decades. Things are never that simple. Whilst Erlendur struggles to hold together the crumbling fragments of his own family, his case unearths many other tales of family pain. The hills have more than one tragic story to tell: tales of failed relationships and heartbreak; of anger, domestic violence and fear; of family loyalty and family shame. Few people are still alive who can tell the story, but even secrets taken to the grave cannot remain hidden forever.</p><p><i>Silence of the Grave</i>Winner of the CWA Golden Dagger Award<br>Translated from the Icelandic by Bernard Scudder<br>&nbsp;<br>Praise for Indridason's previous novel featuring Inspector Erlendur Sveinsson, <i>Jar City</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>"Classic mystery fiction, both compassionate and thrilling.

Beginning with <em>Agamemnon</em>, which describes Agamemnon's return from the Trojan War and his murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra, and continuing through Orestes' murder of Clytemnestra in <em>Libation Bearers</em> and his acquittal at Athena's court in <em>Eumenides</em>, the trilogy traces the evolution of justice in human society from blood vengeance to the rule of law. The story of the house of Atreus is a tale of incest, adultery, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and political intrigue. It is also a story in which human action is simultaneously willed and determined. <br> In this new translation the strangeness of the original Greek and its enduring human truth come alive in language that is remarkable for its unrelenting poetic intensity, its rich metaphorical texture, and a verbal density that can at times modulate into the simplest expressions. The precise but complicated rhythms of this translation honor the music of the original Greek, bringing into unforgettable English the Aeschylean vision of a world fraught with spiritual and political tensions, a world in which justice is a cosmic balance that inevitably rights itself both by means of and despite the evil deeds of characters who claim to act on justice's behalf.</p><p><br><strong>Alan Shapiro</strong> is Professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of a number of prize-winning volumes of poetry and prose, including <em>The Dead Alive and Busy</em>, winner of the 2001 Kingsley Tufts Award. <strong>Peter Burian</strong> is Professor of Classical Studies at Duke University.

Suffering the same fate as many an author who's dared to pen unconventional sequels to a ferociously loved book (in this case, <i>The Forever War</i>), Haldeman has risked the ire of his many devoted admirers a second time (the first sequel was the award-spangled <i>Forever Peace</i>). But Haldeman's call--not too surprisingly--proves to be a deft one, giving us a book that, while significantly different from its predecessor, turns out to be equally captivating and sensitive, in many ways even more thought-provoking. (Sure, it doesn't match <i>The Forever War</i> for sheer impact, but then again, what does?)<p> As in <i>The Forever War</i>, the heart of this story is the dry, ironic bite of fighting-suit vet William Mandella, now middle-aged and a parent (along with his love and comrade-in-arms Marygay) to two teen-aged kids. The family leads a spartan life on the cold and desolate planet Middle Finger, which serves as a sort of genetic safe-deposit box for the current incarnation of humanity, an inhuman race of group-mind clones known as Man. But the animals in the zoo are getting restless, and a core group of vets led by William and Marygay plot an unusual escape: hijacking a reconditioned time ship and using it to take a 40,000 light-year tour (over 10 years of their own time) to rejoin the world they know only after 2,000 generations have passed. Much of the action involves the hatching and fruition of this plot, but Haldeman doesn't really mix things up until nearing the end, when he dissolves physics as we know it and calls down the wrath of God itself. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Joe Haldeman is currently an adjunct professor teaching writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><h2>The Cheshire Cheese Cat: A Dickens of a Tale</h2><p>In this playful homage to Charles Dickens, unlikely allies learn the lessons of a great friendship.<br>Skilley, an alley cat with an embarrassing secret, longs to escape his street-cat life. He hopes to trade London&#x2019;s damp alleyways for the warmth of ye olde Cheshire Cheese Inn, so he strikes a bargain with Pip, an erudite mouse. Skilley will protect the mice who live at the inn, and in turn, the mice will provide Skilley with the thing he desires most. But when Skilley and Pip are drawn into a crisis of monumental proportions, their new friendship is pushed to its limits. The escalating crisis threatens the peace not only of the Cheshire Cheese Inn but also the British Monarchy!<br>New York Times best-selling author Carmen Agra Deedy and author Randall Wright collaborate on this compelling story set in Victorian England. With the stunning artwork of award-winning illustrator Barry Moser, The Cheshire Cheese Cat is filled with charming characters and important themes of friendship and loyalty.</p><p>Carmen Agra Deedy is a New York Times bestselling author and has been writing and traveling around the world telling stories for more than twenty years.

She lives in Georgia.&#x201c;The fast-moving plot is a masterwork of intricate detail that will keep readers enthralled, and the characters are well-rounded and believable. Language is a highlight of the novel; words both elegant and colorful fill the pages... Combined with Moser&#x2019;s precise pencil sketches of personality-filled characters, the book is a success in every way. It should be a first purchase for libraries interested in bringing young readers to the marvels of Dickens via the back &#x2013; or, should I say tavern &#x2013; door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Moser&#x2019;s graphite illustrations are realistic and wonderfully emotive, especially in combination with the novel&#x2019;s fresh dialogue, typographical flights of fancy, and wordplay. Expertly realized characters and effervescent storytelling make this story of unlikely friendship, royal ravens, and &#x2018;the finest cheese in London&#x2019; a delight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Readers with great expectations will find them fully satisfied by this tongue-in-cheek romp through a historic public House that is the very opposite of Bleak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whether you come to this book as an English major or as a cat lover, you will agree the first line of &#x2018;The Cheshire Cheese Cat&#x2019; is pure genius...This joint effort from Carmen Agra Deedy and Randall Wright, illustrated charmingly by Barry Moser, might be best appreciated as a read-aloud. It is sure to spark dialogue about loyalty and bullying...and Anglophiles young and old will appreciate the tale of Maldwyn, an injured raven hiding out at the Cheese and plotting his return to this rightful role guarding the Tower of London...&#x201d;</p><h2>Eyewitness to Power: The Essence of Leadership, Nixon to Clinton</h2><p>An advisor to Nixon and later presidents discusses seven elements of presidential leadership: personal character, moral vision, political skills, media savvy, judgment in choosing advisors, and an interest one&#39;s legacy.</p><p>David Gergen is probably the only person to have served at high levels in both the Reagan and Clinton White Houses--not to mention his posts in the Nixon and Ford administrations. He's a consummate Washington insider, a man who appears regularly as a centrist political commentator on PBS's <i>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i> and works as editor at large for <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. <i>Eyewitness to Power</i>, his first book, draws upon this unique experience. It's part memoir, part political history, part portrait of White House culture, but it's mostly a meditation on what it takes to be a great political leader. Gergen focuses on the four presidents he has known best--Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton--and offers pointed assessments of each. He calls Reagan "the best leader in the White House since Franklin Roosevelt," and says Clinton "is one of the smartest men ever elected president and has done some of the dumbest things." Gergen does not hesitate to offer harsh criticism: Nixon was hateful, Ford was overwhelmed by his predecessor's scandals, Reagan was often detached, and Clinton was not in control of his appetites. Yet there's a reflective admiration for each man.<p> What makes this volume rise above the mountain of books on leadership (usually written for executives) is its spot-on observations about the way Washington works, drawn from years of experience: "Republicans like hierarchy and order; they're not like Democrats, as I saw later on, who thrive on chaos and creativity"; the Nixon view of Watergate "was the same as the Victorians had of adultery: the sin was not in the doing of it but in getting caught"; "In most institutions, the power of a leader grows over time. A CEO, a university president, the head of a union, acquire stature through the quality of their long-term performance. The presidency is just the opposite: power tends to evaporate quickly."</p><p> Gergen concludes by describing the seven leadership qualities a great president must have: personal integrity, a sense of mission, the ability to persuade, the ability to work with other politicians, a strong start after inauguration, skilled advisers, and the ability to inspire. Those traits, of course, will serve people well from all walks of life--and <i>Eyewitness to Power</i> will appeal not just to readers interested in the presidency but to anyone occupying a position of responsibility (or interested in getting there). <i>--John J.

Trying to cut wood with a dull saw, remove a screw with nicked screwdriver, or cut a hinge mortise with a dull chisel will be more difficult and create messy results. It can turn a simple repair into a major frustration, resulting in bruised knuckles and bandaged fingers. This is a book to keep within easy reach in the workshop, and it includes instructions about sharpening knives and scissors, too. Excellent photos and diagrams make the instructions easy to understand and follow, even for a beginner.Titles such as this one usually get yawns from most woodworkers, but those among them who still have all of their fingers are likely to be the ones who've actually read one. Assuredly, Geary breaks no new ground here, but he does make a very thorough job of it, since he covers how to sharpen, not only blades, but all of those router bits, chisels, and other cutters one manages to accumulate. Woodworkers ought to own or at least thoroughly peruse a copy of a book like this and at least attempt to do their own sharpening, if only to keep their tools safe. Only then, if and when they get fed up with the monotony of sharpening, should they ship their blades, bits, and saws off to the local sharpening service, for then they may be able to evaluate just what that sharpening service does day after day after day after day. <i>Jon Kartman</i></p><h2>Practicing the Presence</h2><p>A practical introduction to metaphysics and mysticism designed to heighten spiritual consciousness, realization of the spirit of God through meditation, and awareness of God&#39;s power in daily life</p><p></p><h2>A Guest for the Night: A Novel (Library Of World Fiction)</h2><p><p>Hailed as one of Agnon&#x2019;s most significant works, <i>A Guest for the Night</i> depicts Jewish life in Eastern Europe after World War I.

She lives in Westport, Massachusetts.Barack Obama CHAPTER 1<p></p> BARACK OBAMA JR.<p></p> <br>ON AUGUST 4, 1961, A baby boy was born at kapi?&#x2018;olani Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. He weighed eight pounds, two ounces. His parents, Ann and Barack, named him after his father, Barack Hussein Obama, but they called their child &#x201c;Barry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Barack Obama Sr. was a foreign exchange student from Kenya, a country in east-central Africa. He was twenty-five years old, studying on a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. He was the very first African student at the school.<br> <br>Barack was tall and charming, with a voice &#x201c;like black velvet,&#x201d; as his mother-in-law Madelyn Dunham described it, &#x201c;with a British accent.&#x201d; He had come from a poor family, herding goats as a boy. His father, of the Luo tribe, had been a domestic servant for the British colonials. Now Kenya was on the brink of gaining independence from Britain.<br> <br>Barack was determined to accomplish great things, both for himself and for his country. It was a great honor for a youth from his humble background to study at American schools and earn an advanced degree in economics. But he also had a heavy responsibility to his people, and he intended to return to Kenya and help lead the country into a brighter future.<br> <br>Ann Dunham was an eighteen-year-old freshman at the University of Hawaii in 1960 when she met Barack in a Russian class. A quiet but independent-minded girl, she had dark curly hair and dark eyebrows like her father&#x2019;s. She read serious books about reforming society, and she eagerly spent hours in long, earnest discussions with her friends.<br> <br>Ann lived with her parents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham, in a rambling house near the university campus. Stanley was a furniture salesman, while Madelyn worked for a bank. Both Stanley and Madelyn had grown up in Kansas, but after they married, they lived in several states before settling in Hawaii.<br> <br>When Ann first brought Barack home for dinner, her parents, especially Madelyn, were uneasy. They had never met anyone from Africa before. But Barack quickly won them over with his charm, and they were impressed with his brilliant mind and his confidence.<br> <br>However, the Dunhams were unpleasantly surprised in February 1961, when Ann and Barack eloped to the island of Maui and came back married. Stanley and Madelyn were disappointed that Ann, so bright and inquisitive of mind, was dropping out of college after only one semester. Madelyn also feared that the cultural differences between their American daughter and this African young man were too great.<br> <br>Barack&#x2019;s father, Hussein Onyango Obama, who lived in Kenya, was also surprised and very upset at the news. He threatened to get Barack&#x2019;s travel visa canceled, so he&#x2019;d have to return to Kenya. He pointed out that Barack already had family responsibilities: a wife and two children in Kenya. Also, he warned his son, an American wife wasn&#x2019;t likely to be understanding about the Kenyan custom of a man having more than one family. Furthermore, Onyango wrote Stanley Dunham a long, angry letter. As Barry&#x2019;s mother told him years later, Barack&#x2019;s father &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t want the Obama blood sullied by a white woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>Barack refused to obey his father, and the Dunhams accepted their daughter&#x2019;s choice. For two years Barack and Ann lived with their baby in a small white house near the university campus. Then in 1963, Barack graduated from the University of Hawaii and won a scholarship to study economics at Harvard University in Massachusetts. The scholarship didn&#x2019;t allow enough money to bring Ann and their son with him, but Barack felt he couldn&#x2019;t pass up the chance to study at such a prestigious university. In the end, he left Hawaii for Massachusetts by himself.<br> <br>Barack Sr. intended to eventually take his wife and son back to Kenya, after he had earned his PhD in economics. But Ann decided that this marriage would not work. Barack might love her and Barry, but his wife and son were not as important as his fierce ambition or his commitment to Kenya. Besides, it did matter to Ann, as Barack&#x2019;s father had predicted, that Barack had a wife and children in Kenya. In January 1964, she filed for divorce.<br> <br>During his first years, Barry didn&#x2019;t wonder why his father was missing. Family pictures show him happily riding his tricycle or perched on a fence with his mother&#x2019;s arm around him. In another picture from those days, Barry frolics in the surf with his grandfather Stanley (whom Barry called &#x201c;Gramps&#x201d;). A boisterous, outgoing man, Stanley was delighted to have Barry to play with and show off to friends and neighbors. Madelyn Dunham was more practical and sensible, but she too doted on their grandson. She told him to call her &#x201c;Tutu,&#x201d; Hawaiian for &#x201c;grandmother,&#x201d; and the name got shortened to &#x201c;Toot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Barry&#x2019;s mother and grandparents talked to him about his father, but they never criticized Barack Sr. to Barry. Ann especially must have felt pain and anger over the failed marriage, but she didn&#x2019;t say anything to Barry about that. The worst thing she said about Barack Obama was that he was a terrible driver.<br> <br>Ann told Barry that he had a wonderful father&#x2014;fiercely intelligent, with a deep baritone voice and a way of commanding people&#x2019;s attention. She showed him pictures of Barack Sr., a dark-skinned man with glasses. She told him his father loved him very much.<br> <br>Although Barry wouldn&#x2019;t realize it for many years, his mother was just as remarkable as his father. Her full name was Stanley Ann Dunham, because her father had wished for a son. Growing up, she didn&#x2019;t like having a boy&#x2019;s name, but feeling different from other children may have made her more independent as well.<br> <br>Once, when the Dunhams were living in Texas, Ann brought a black friend home to play. That would have been fine with Ann&#x2019;s parents, but the neighborhood children taunted the girls with racial slurs, driving the black girl away. Even more disturbing, the adult townspeople blamed the incident on the Dunhams. Instead of scolding their own children, they advised the Dunhams not to let Ann associate with black playmates.<br> <br>When Ann was in the eighth grade, the family moved to Seattle, Washington. Stanley was offered a better job in a furniture store there, and they were all glad to leave Texas. Madelyn found a job in a bank. In 1956, the Dunhams bought a house on Mercer Island, near Seattle, so that Ann could attend the new high school there.<br> <br>Ann was an idealistic and curious girl, with a mind of her own. Some of her high school friends were surprised that she didn&#x2019;t feel any need to fit in with other young people. She didn&#x2019;t seem to have the usual interest in dating or eventually getting married and having children.<br> <br>What did interest Ann were current events and the controversial ideas set forth by her English and philosophy teachers. These teachers angered many in the community by questioning religion, the U.S. political system, and other parts of the American way of life. Some of the thought-provoking books they assigned were Vance Packard&#x2019;s The Hidden Persuaders, about the power of advertising; George Orwell&#x2019;s 1984, a novel about a grim future in which the countries of the world are always at war and the government controls citizens&#x2019; minds with lies and violence; and William Whyte&#x2019;s The Organization Man, which described big American corporations as controlling every aspect of their employees&#x2019; lives.<br> <br>Ann and her friends had long discussions on such topics after school in coffee shops. She spent much of her free time reading. She was fascinated with other cultures, and she was idealistic about how people&#x2019;s lives could be improved.<br> <br>Toward the end of her high school career, Ann applied to the University of Chicago and received early acceptance. The University of Chicago, with its reputation for intellectual excitement, in the middle of a big city, appealed to Ann&#x2019;s sense of adventure. However, Stanley Dunham didn&#x2019;t want his daughter living on her own, far away from home, at such a young age.<br> <br>After Ann&#x2019;s graduation from high school, in 1960, Stanley heard that a new opportunity was opening up in the furniture business in Honolulu. Always ready for a new adventure and hopeful for a better life somewhere else, he decided to move the family to Hawaii.<br> <br>Ann resented her father for running her life, and she was reluctant to leave Seattle. But Hawaii wasn&#x2019;t such a bad place to be: a land of warm, sandy beaches and transparent blue water, of steep rain forest&#x2013;covered hills with waterfalls and ginger flowers. Also, in Hawaii, Ann encountered people with an interesting mix of backgrounds: Japanese, Filipino, Polynesian. Ann enrolled in the University of Hawaii to study anthropology. She soon fell in with a group of students who shared her interest in politics and world affairs. One of them&#x2014;the one with the most forceful, confident opinions&#x2014;was Barack Obama.<br> <br>After divorcing Barack in 1964, Ann went back to school at the University of Hawaii. She had no money, but she got by with food stamps and with her parents&#x2019; help. While Ann was in class, Barry&#x2019;s grandparents took care of him.<br> <br>Ann soon met another foreign exchange student she liked very much, an Indonesian man named Lolo Soetoro. Indonesia, like Kenya, was a recently independent country. Lolo&#x2019;s father and brother had both died in the struggle against the Dutch colonialists, and the Dutch army had burned their house. Lolo was proud of his country and wanted to contribute to building a better Indonesia. He planned to teach at the university when he returned to Jakarta, the capital city.<br> <br>Having a much more easygoing personality than Barack Sr., Lolo got along well with the Dunhams. He enjoyed tussling with young Barry and playing chess with Stanley. Lolo wanted to remain in Hawaii until he finished his studies, but Indonesia in the mid-1960s was a country in turmoil.<br> <br>President Sukarno had ruled Indonesia since the declaration of independence in 1945, but there was increasing unrest against his government. In 1965 the army led a violent anti-communist purge in which hundreds of thousands died. In 1966, Lolo was ordered back to Indonesia to serve in the army. He and Ann decided to marry before he left, with the plan that she and Barry would join him several months later.<br> <br>Stanley was excited for Ann and Barry, moving to a place more exotic than Hawaii, with tigers and monsoons. Madelyn was worried that the country might not be safe for them, because of the political upheaval. Ann and Barry needed to get shots and passports, since they&#x2019;d never left the United States before. In 1967 they boarded a plane to fly first to Japan and then to Jakarta, Indonesia, about a third of the way around the globe from Hawaii.</p><h2>Nation</h2><p>Alone on a desert island &#x2014; everything and everyone he knows and loves has been washed away in a storm &#x2014; Mau is the last surviving member of his nation. He&#x2019;s completely alone &#x2014; or so he thinks until he finds the ghost girl. She has no toes, wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird, and gives him a stick that can make fire.<br>Daphne, sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy, almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy. Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark. She&#x2019;s certain her father, distant cousin of the Royal family, will come and rescue her but it seems, for now, that all she has for company is the boy and the foul-mouthed ship&#x2019;s parrot, until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island. Together, Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things (including how to milk a pig, and why spitting in beer is a good thing), and start to forge a new nation.<br><br>Encompassing themes of death and nationhood, Terry Pratchett&#x2019;s new novel is, as can be expected, extremely funny, witty and wise. Mau&#x2019;s ancestors have something to teach us all. Mau just wishes they would shut up about it and let him get on with saving everyone&#x2019;s lives!</p><p>Terry Pratchett is the author of the phenomenally successful Discworld series. His first Discworld novel for children, <b>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</b> was awarded the 2001 Carnegie Medal.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Starred Review. Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;In this first novel for young people set outside of Discworld, Pratchett again shows his humor and humanity. Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor. Daphne is a close literary cousin of Tiffany Aching in her common sense and keen intelligence wedded to courage. A rich and thought-provoking read.&#x2014;<i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mr. Burge lay in comfort on a couch the better to expound the complications of his psyche. Dr. Steiner sat at his head in a chair of the carefully documented type which the Hospital Management Committee had decreed for the use of consultants. It was functional and not unattractive but it gave no support to the back of the head. From time to time a sharp jerk of his neck muscles recalled Dr. Steiner from momentary oblivion to the realities of his Friday evening psychotherapy clinic. The October day had been very warm. After a fortnight of sharp frosts during which the staff of the clinic had shivered and pleaded, the official date for starting the central heating had coincided with one of those perfect autumn days when the city square outside had brimmed with yellow light and the late dahlias in the railed garden, bright as a paintbox, had shone like the gauds of high summer. It was now nearly seven o'clock. Outside, the warmth of the day had long given way, first to mist and then to chilly darkness. But here, inside the clinic, the heat of noon was trapped, the air, heavy and still, seemed spent with the breath of too much talking.<br><br>Mr. Burge enlarged on the immaturity, coldness and insensitivity of his wives in a querulous falsetto. Dr. Steiner's clinical judgment, not uninfluenced by the late effects of a large lunch and the unwise choice of a cream doughnut with his afternoon tea, told him that the time was not yet ripe to point out that the one defect shared by the three mesdames Burge had been a singular lack of judgment in their choice of husband. Mr. Burge was not yet ready to face the truth of his own inadequacy.<br><br>Dr. Steiner felt no moral indignation about his patient's behaviour. It would indeed have been most unethical had any such improper emotion clouded his judgment. There were few things in life which aroused Dr. Steiner's moral indignation and most of them affected his own comfort. Many of them were, indeed, concerned with the Steen Clinic and its administration. He disapproved strongly of the administrative officer, Miss Bolam, whose preoccupation with the number of patients he saw in a session and the accuracy of his travelling expense form he saw as part of a systematic policy of persecution. He resented the fact that his Friday evening clinic coincided with Dr. James Baguley's electro-convulsive therapy session so that his psychotherapy patients, all of them of high intelligence and sensible of the privilege of being treated by him, had to sit in the waiting-room with the motley crowd of depressed suburban housewives and ill-educated psychotics that Baguley seemed to delight in collecting. Dr. Steiner had refused the use of one of the third-floor consulting-rooms. These had been formed by partitioning the large and elegant Georgian rooms and he despised them as badly proportioned and unpleasing cells, ill-suited either to his grade or to the importance of his work. Nor had he found it convenient to change the time of his session. Baguley, therefore, should change his. But Dr. Baguley had stood firm and in this, too, Dr. Steiner had seen the influence of Miss Bolam. His plea that the ground floor consulting-rooms should be sound-proofed had been turned down by the Hospital Management Committee on the grounds of expense. There had, however, been no demur over providing Baguley with a new and highly expensive contraption for shocking his patients out of the few wits they still possessed. The matter, had, of course, been considered by the Clinic Medical Committee, but Miss Bolam had made no secret of where her sympathies lay. In his diatribes against the administrative officer, Dr. Steiner found it convenient to forget that her influence over the Medical Committee was non-existent.<br><br>It was difficult to forget the irritations of the E.C.T. session. The clinic building had been put up when men built to last, but even the sturdy oak door of the consulting-room could not muffle the comings and goings of a Friday night. The front door was closed at 6 p.m. and patients at the evening clinics were booked in and out since the time, over five years ago, when a patient had entered unobserved, secreted herself in the basement lavatory and chosen that insalubrious place in which to kill herself. Dr. Steiner's psychotherapy sessions were punctuated by the ringing of the front-door bell, the passing of feet as patients came and went, the hearty voices of relatives and escorts exhorting the patient or calling good-byes to Sister Ambrose. Dr. Steiner wondered why relatives found it necessary to shout at the patients as if they were deaf as well as psychotic. But possibly after a session with Baguley and his diabolic machine they were. Worst of all was the clinic domestic assistant, Mrs. Shorthouse. One might imagine that Amy Shorthouse could do the cleaning early in the mornings as was surely the normal arrangement. That way there would be the minimum of disturbance to the clinic staff. But Mrs. Shorthouse maintained that she couldn't get through the work without an extra two hours in the evenings and Miss Bolam had agreed. Naturally, she would. It appeared to Dr. Steiner that very little domestic work was done on Friday evenings. Mrs. Shorthouse had a predilection for the E.C.T. patients -- indeed, her own husband had once been treated by Dr. Baguley -- and she was usually to be seen hanging around the hall and the ground floor general office while the session was being held. Dr. Steiner had mentioned it at the Medical Committee more than once and had been irritated by his colleagues' general uninterest in the problem. Mrs. Shorthouse should be kept out of sight and encouraged to get on with her work, not permitted to stand around gossiping with the patients. Miss Bolam, so unnecessarily strict with other members of the staff, showed no inclination to discipline Mrs. Shorthouse. Everyone knew that good domestic workers were hard to get but an administrative officer who knew her job would recruit them somehow. Weakness solved nothing. But Baguley could not be persuaded to complain about Mrs. Shorthouse and Bolam would never criticize Baguley. The poor woman was probably in love with him. It was up to Baguley to take a firm line instead of sloping around the clinic in that ridiculously long white coat which made him look like a second-rate dentist. Really, the man had no idea of the dignity with which a consultant clinic should be conducted.<br><br>Clump, clump went someone's boots along the passage. It was probably old Tippett, a chronic schizophrenic patient of Baguley's who, for the past nine years, had regularly spent Friday evenings carving wood in the art therapy department. The thought of Tippett increased Dr. Steiner's petulance. The man was totally unsuitable for the Steen. If he were well enough to be out of hospital, which Dr. Steiner doubted, he ought to attend a Day Hospital or one of the County Council's sheltered workshops. It was patients like Tippett who gave the clinic a dubious reputation and obscured its real function as an analytically orientated centre of psychotherapy. Dr. Steiner felt positively embarrassed when one of his own carefully selected patients encountered Tippett creeping about the clinic on a Friday evening. Tippett wasn't even safe to be out. One day there would be an incident and Baguley would find himself in trouble.<br><br>Dr. Steiner's happy contemplation of his colleague in trouble was punctured by the ring of the front-door bell. Really, it was impossible! This time it was apparently a hospital car service driver calling for a patient. Mrs. Shorthouse went to the door to speed them away. Her eldritch screech echoed through the hall. "Cheerio, ducks. See you next week. If you can't be good be careful."<br><br>Dr. Steiner winced and shut his eyes. But his patient, happily engaged in his favourite hobby of talking about himself, seemed not to have heard. Mr. Burge's high whine had not, in fact, faltered for the past twenty minutes.<br><br>"I don't pretend I'm an easy person. I'm not, I'm a complicated devil. That's something which Theda and Sylvia had never understood. The roots of it go deep of course. You remember that session we had in June? Some pretty basic stuff came out then I thought."<br><br>His therapist did not recall the session in question but was unconcerned. With Mr. Burge pretty basic stuff was invariably near the surface and could be trusted to emerge. An unaccountable peace fell. Dr. Steiner doodled on his notepad, regarded his doodle with interest, and concern, looked at it again with the pad held upside down and became for a moment more preoccupied with his own subconscious than with that of his patient. Suddenly he became aware of another sound from outside, faint at first and then becoming louder. Somewhere a woman was screaming. It was a horrible noise, high, continuous, and completely animal. Its effect on Dr. Steiner was peculiarly unpleasant. He was naturally timid and highly strung. Although his job involved him in the occasional emotional crises he was more adept at circumventing than coping with an emergency. Fear gave vent to irritation and he sprang from his chair exclaiming.<br><br>"No! Really, this is too bad! What's Miss Bolam doing? Isn't anyone supposed to be in charge here?"<br><br>"What's up?" inquired Mr. Burge, sitting up like a jack-in-the-box and dropping his voice half an octave to its more normal tone.<br><br>"Nothing. Nothing. Some woman having an attack of hysteria that's all. Stay where you are. I'll be back," commanded Dr. Steiner.<br><br>Mr. Burge collapsed again but with eye and ear cocked for the door. Dr. Steiner found himself in the hall.<br><br>Immediately a little group swung round to face him. Jennifer Priddy, the junior typist, was clinging to one of the porters, Peter Nagle, who was patting her shoulder in embarrassed pity and looking puzzled. Mrs. Shorthouse was with them. The girl's screams were subsiding into whimpers but her whole body was shaking, and she was deathly pale.<br><br>"What's the matter?" asked Dr. Steiner sharply. "What's wrong with her?"<br><br>Before anyone had a chance to reply the door of the E.C.T. room opened and Dr. Baguley came out followed by Sister Ambrose and his anaesthetist, Dr. Mary Ingram. The hall seemed suddenly full of people. "Calm down, that's a good girl," said Dr. Baguley mildly. "We're trying to run a clinic." He turned to Peter Nagle and asked in a low voice: "What's the matter anyway?"<br><br>Nagle seemed about to speak when, suddenly, Miss Priddy gained control. Breaking free of him she turned to Dr. Baguley and said with absolute clearness:<br><br>"It's Miss Bolam. She's dead. Someone's killed her. She's in the basement record room and she's murdered. I found her. Enid's been murdered!"<br><br>She clung to Nagle and began to cry again but more quietly. The dreadful shaking had ceased. Dr. Baguley said to the porter:<br><br>"Take her into the treatment-room. Make her lie down. Better give her something to drink. Here's the key. I'll be back."<br><br>He made for the basement stairs and the rest, abandoning the girl to Nagle's ministrations, followed in a jostling bunch. The basement at the Steen was well lit; all its rooms were used by the clinic which, like most psychiatric units, was chronically short of space. Here, below stairs, in addition to the boiler-room, the telephone equipment-room and the porters' quarters, was the art therapy department, a medical records storeroom and, at the front of the building, a treatment-room for the lysergic acid patients. As the little group reached the bottom of the stairs the door of this room opened and Nurse Bolam, Miss Bolam's cousin, looked out briefly -- a shadowy wraith in her white uniform against the darkness of the room behind. Her gentle, puzzled voice floated to them down the corridor. "Is there anything wrong? I thought I heard a scream a few minutes ago."<br><br>Sister Ambrose said with brusque authority:<br><br>"There's nothing wrong, Nurse. Get back to your patient."<br><br>The white figure disappeared and the door was shut. Turning to Mrs. Shorthouse, Sister Ambrose went on:<br><br>"And there's nothing for you to do here, Mrs. Shorthouse. Please stay upstairs. Miss Priddy might like a cup of tea."<br><br>Mrs. Shorthouse was heard to mutter rebelliously but beat a reluctant retreat. The three doctors, with sister in tow, pressed on.<br><br>The medical record-room was on their right, between the porters' rest-room and the art therapy department. The door was ajar and the light was on.<br><br>Dr. Steiner, who had become unnaturally aware of every small detail, noticed the key was in the lock. No one was about. The steel racks, with their tight-packed rows of manilla folders, ran ceiling high and at right angles to the door forming a series of narrow aisles, each lit by a fluorescent light. The four high windows were barred and dissected by the racks; it was an airless little room rarely visited and seldom dusted. The little group pushed its way down the first passage and turned left to where there was a small windowless space clear of shelving and furnished with a table and chair where records could be sorted for filing or information copied from the notes without the need to take the file away. Here was chaos. The chair was overturned. The floor was littered with records. Some had their covers wrenched apart and their pages torn, others lay dumped in shifting layers beneath gaps on the shelves which looked too narrow to have held such a weight of paper. And in the middle of this confusion, like a plump and incongruous Ophelia afloat on a tide of paper, was the body of Enid Bolam. On her chest rested a heavy and grotesque image carved in wood, her hands folded about its base so that she looked, horribly, like a parody of motherhood with her creature ritually laid to her breast.<br><br>There could be no doubt that she was dead. Even in the midst of his fear and repugnance Dr. Steiner could not miss that final diagnosis. Staring at the wooden figure he cried:<br><br>"Tippett! That's his fetish! That's the carving he's so proud of. Where is he? Baguley, he's your patient! You'd better handle this!"<br><br>He looked round nervously as if expecting Tippett to materialize, arm raised to strike, the very personification of violence.<br><br>Dr. Baguley was kneeling by the body. He said quietly:<br><br>"Tippett isn't here this evening."<br><br>"But he's always here on Fridays! That's his fetish! That's the weapon!" Dr. Steiner wailed against such obtuseness.<br><br>Dr. Baguley gently lifted Miss Bolam's left eyelid with his thumb. Without looking up he said:<br><br>"We had a phone call from St. Luke's this morning. Tippett's been admitted with pneumonia. Last Monday, I think. Anyway, he wasn't here this evening." Suddenly he gave a exclamation. The two women bent closer to the body. Dr. Steiner, who could not bring himself to watch the examination, heard him say:<br><br>"She's been stabbed, too. Through the heart by the look of it and with a black-handled chisel. Isn't this one of Nagle's, Sister?" There was a pause and Dr. Steiner heard Sister's voice:<br><br>"It looks very like it, Doctor. All his tools have black handles. He keeps them in the porters' rest-room." She added defensively, "Anyone could get at them."<br><br>"It looks as if someone has." There was the sound of Dr. Baguley getting to his feet. Still keeping his eyes on the body he said: "Phone Cully on the door, will you, Sister. Don't alarm him, but tell him that no one is to be admitted or to leave the building. That includes the patients. Then get Dr. Etherege and ask him to come down. He'll ...</p><h2>A Summer Affair: A Novel</h2><p>Claire Danner Crispin, mother of four young children and nationally renowned glassblower, bites off more than she can chew when she agrees to co-chair the Nantucket's Children Summer Gala. Claire is asked to chair the benefit, in part, because she is the former high school sweetheart of rock star Max West. Max agrees to play the gala and it looks like smooth sailing for Claire-until she promises a "museum-quality" piece of glass for the auction, offers her best friend the catering job, goes nose-to-nose with her Manhattan socialite co-chair, and begins a "good-hearted" affair with the charity's Executive Director, Lockhart Dixon.<br>Hearts break and emotions are pushed to the limit in this riveting story of one woman's attempt to deal with loves past and present, family, business, and high-powered social pressures. Elin Hilderbrand's unique understanding of the joys and longings that animate women's lives will make this her newest summer bestseller.</p><p>Elin Hilderbrand lives on Nantucket with her husband and their three young children. She grew up in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and traveled extensively before settling on Nantucket, which has been the setting for her six previous novels. Hilderbrand is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the graduate fiction workshop at the University of Iowa.Hilderbrand's seventh novel delves into the psyche of a guilt-ridden mother/artist who embarks on a self-destructive path. Nantucket glass artist Claire Danner Crispin has pieces in private collections and one in the Whitney, but is overwhelmed with the needs of her husband and four kids (she gave up full-time glassblowing to take care of the family). Her troubles worsen when Daphne, a friend she'd been drinking with, is severely injured in a drunken car wreck. Claire is convinced that Daphne's husband, Lockhart, holds her responsible, so she's surprised when he asks her to co-chair a charity gala and create a new piece of glass art for auction. The plot mushrooms as Claire and Lockhart begin an affair; Claire rethinks her priorities; a slew of gala-related complications arise; and Claire's ex-boyfriend turned rock star comes into play. Hilderbrand keeps a lot of balls in the air, and if she pays too much attention to event-planning minutiae, there are still enough conflicts to keep readers entertained. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Heminway lives in New York and Montana.Already acclaimed for his outstanding writings on Africa, Heminway has discovered a new land of natural splendor and human adventure: Montana. In purchasing a 36-acre ranch (the Bar 20) in the West Boulder Valley, Heminway acquired a piece of geography as beautiful yet treacherous as any African veldt. But he also bought into a tangled history that is distinctly American. Previous owners of this homestead left a tantalizing trail of clues as to their lives of heroic daring--and cruel illusions. Heminway invests his greatest effort in probing the lives of Stanley and Lucille "Bab" Cox--the "fountainhead dreamers"--transplanted Easterners who made a gutsy, 18-year stand on this unforgiving terrain. Yet if the fortitude of this mysterious pair conceals some dark secrets, so, too, do the brave cowboy legends of the earlier white settlers who took the land from the Crow, the Sioux, the Cheyenne, and other tribes, so destroying their way of life. The ghosts of these tragically displaced peoples still move with their ancient dignity through this stirring celebration of the magnificent land they once called theirs. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sex therapist, sociologist, and <em>Psychology Today</em> contributor Dr. Marty Klein goes beyond the sex manuals to reveal how our mindsets during sex are more important than any tricks or techniques&#x2014;and that the way to a healthier, more exciting, more fulfilling sex life lies in first developing our sexual intelligence. This book is the antidote to the many gimmick-oriented sex guides and manuals; Dr. Klein shows us how to reorient how we think about sex in order to experience a truly different way of being sexual.<p>&#x201c;Marty Klein is the Steve Jobs of sex advice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>Sexual Intelligence </em>is a work of enormous wisdom and expansiveness, and will inspire readers, regardless of age, to realize their full sexual potential.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Ian Kerner, best-selling author of <em>She Comes First</em><br></p></p><p><p>Enjoyable sex: it&#x2019;s not about technique or a perfect body or being hopelessly, passionately in love.

Instead, we&#x2019;re preoccupied with how we look, what our partner is thinking, how we&#x2019;re performing, and whether we&#x2019;re &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; We do more thinking, worrying, and judging than <em>experiencing</em>. Sex like that can&#x2019;t thrill us, can&#x2019;t create intimacy, and can&#x2019;t, well, feel sexy.</p><p>In <em>Sexual Intelligenc</em>e, Klein shows how to stop observing ourselves during sex, ending our obsession with sexual performance and sexual normality. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t help people &#x2018;function&#x2019; better during sex,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I teach people how to relax and enjoy sex with the body they have, the partner they have, in the situation they have.&#x201d; Now that&#x2019;s something we all want: fulfilling, exciting sex at every stage of our lives.</p><p>In <em>Sexual Intelligence</em>, Klein challenges our understanding of sex, love, intimacy, romance, and satisfaction.

(c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Yellow Wallpaper (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>The Yellow Wallpaper is a short story by American writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman, first published in January 1892 in The New England Magazine. It is regarded as an important early work of American feminist literature, illustrating attitudes in the nineteenth century toward women&#39;s physical and mental health. The story also has been classified as Gothic fiction and horror fiction. &#34;The Yellow Wallpaper&#34; is written in epistolary style, specifically as a collection of first person journal entries written by a woman whose physician husband has confined her to the upstairs bedroom of a house that he has rented for the summer. She is forbidden from working, and has to hide her journal entries from him, so that she can recuperate from what he calls a &#34;temporary nervous depression;a slight hysterical tendency,&#34; a diagnosis common to women in that period. Her husband controls her access to the rest of the house. A key locks the door. The story depicts the effect of confinement on the narrator&#39;s mental health, and her descent into psychosis. With nothing to stimulate her, she becomes obsessed by the pattern and color of the wallpaper. &#34;It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw ; not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things. But there is something else about that paper;the smell! ... The only thing I can think of that it is like, is the color of the paper! A yellow smell.&#34; In the end, she imagines that there are women creeping around behind the patterns of the wallpaper, and comes to believe that she is one of them. She locks herself in the room, now the only place where she feels safe, refusing to leave when the summer rental is up. &#34;For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow. But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.&#34;</p><p>Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was a prominent American sociologist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction, and a lecturer for social reform. She was a utopian feminist during a time when her accomplishments were exceptional for women, and she served as a role model for future generations of feminists because of her unorthodox concepts and lifestyle. Her best remembered work today is her semi-autobiographical short story The Yellow Wallpaper which she wrote after a severe bout of postpartum psychosis.In 1892 an unnamed woman passes the slow days of summer writing down her innermost thoughts while convalescing. Her observations focus on the strange effects of the peeling, fading, yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The Spencer Library has created a unique audio experience in this chilling tale with profound psychological and moral implications. Claudette Sutherland gives a remarkable performance. Her subtly expressive voice is so skillfully recorded that her soft intakes of breath have a desperate life of their own. The haunting beauty of Carol Nethen&#39;s original score can momentarily distract, but it supports more than it interferes, a tribute both to the composer and to the excellence of the recording standards. The listener is rewarded with a fully realized dramatic performance with a strong musical presence. C.T. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Fanny J.

Journey inside the demented mind of Albert Fish -- pedophile, sadist, and cannibal killer -- and discover that bloodlust knows no time or place.... </p><p> On a warm spring day in 1928, a kindly, white-haired man appeared at the Budd family home in New York City, and soon persuaded Mr. and Mrs. Budd to let him take their adorable little girl, Grace, on an outing. The Budds never guessed that they had entrusted their child to a monster. After a relentless six-year search and nationwide press coverage, the mystery of Grace Budd's disappearance was solved -- and a crime of unparalleled gore and revulsion was revealed to a stunned American public. What Albert Fish did to Grace Budd, and perhaps fifteen other young children, caused experts to pronounce him the most deranged human being they had ever seen.</p></p><p>Harold Schechter is a professor of American culture at Queens College (CUNY) who takes an academic interest in the history of violent folklore: "Our pop entertainments aren't necessarily more brutal than those of the past," he writes. "They are simply ... more state of the art." In this book Schechter turns his keen historian's gaze on real-life serial killer Albert Fish, who killed--and ate--as many as 15 children in New York City in the 20s. Fish resembled a meek, kindly, white-haired grandfather, but was actually an intense sadomasochist whose sexual fetishes included almost everything known to psychiatry. For example, he stuck 29 needles into his pelvic region. Apparently Schechter, while writing his book <i>Deviant</i> about Ed Gein, asked Robert Bloch (author of <i>Psycho</i>), "Why are people so fascinated by Ed Gein?" Bloch answered, "Because they haven't heard about Albert Fish." <br> Also recommended: <i>Depraved</i>, Schechter's book about Herman Mudgett a.k.a. Dr. H. H.

But our record will not be what motivates me. Years ago I was asked, 'Pete, which is better: winning or competing?' My response was instantaneous: 'Competing. . . because it lasts longer.'" </b> <br><br> Pete Carroll is one of the most successful coaches in football today. As the head coach at USC, he brought the Trojans back to national prominence, amassing a 97-19 record over nine seasons. Now he shares the championship-winning philosophy that led USC to seven straight Pac-10 titles. This same mind=set and culture will shape his program as he returns to the NFL to coach the Seattle Seahawks. <br><br> Carroll developed his unique coaching style by trial and error over his career. He learned that you get better results by teaching instead of screaming, and by helping players grow as people, not just on the field. He learned that an upbeat, energetic atmosphere in the locker room can coexist with an unstoppable competitive drive. He learned why you should stop worrying about your opponents, why you should always act as if the whole world is watching, and many other contrarian insights. <br><br> Carroll shows us how the Win Forever philosophy really works, both in NCAA Division I competition and in the NFL. He reveals how his recruiting strategies, training routines, and game-day rituals preserve a team's culture year after year, during championship seasons and disappointing seasons alike. <br><br> <i>Win Forever</i> is about more than winning football games; it's about maximizing your potential in every aspect of your life. Carroll has taught business leaders facing tough challenges. He has helped troubled kids on the streets of Los Angeles through his foundation A Better LA. His words are true in any situation: "If you want to win forever, always compete."</p><p>Pete Carroll is the coach of the Seattle Seahawks. He previously spent nine years as the head coach of the USC Trojans football team. Before coming to USC, he was the head coach of the New York Jets and the New England Patriots and defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. Carroll is also known for his charity work and will donate a portion of his proceeds to A Better LA, his nonprofit organization devoted to reducing gang violence in the most crime-plagued neighborhoods of Los Angeles. He and his wife, Glena, have three grown children.<p> </p><br><p>Kristoffer A. Garin is a journalist who has written for the <b>New York Daily News</b> and the <b>Journal News</b> in Westchester, New York.</p>"Pete Carroll is one of my favorite figures in America. He's the classic example of the fact that you don't have to be miserable to be a champion. You can actually have fun and make it fun." <br> -President Bill Clinton <br><br> "Pete Carroll presents great advice on how to be a winner in life. The twist is that the key is to focus on the process, not the outcome, and to compete hard in every way on your journey. It has certainly worked for Pete, who is a winner in so many ways, and it can work for anybody in all different aspects of life." <br> -NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell <br><br> "During his time at USC Pete Carroll raised the bar in college football coaching with 7 straight BCS appearances, but as you'll read in Win Forever, his ultra competitive spirit and infectious energetic attitude have been the foundation to his many successes both on and off the field." <br> -Kirk Herbstreit, analyst for ESPN's College GameDay <br><br> "Coach Carroll is the fiercest competitor I know. Not only as a coach, but as a mentor and more importantly, a friend. That mentality allowed me to enter the NFL with the tools necessary for the highest level of competition. Furthermore, those traits transcended off the field and will offer a competitive edge for anyone who reads his book." <br> -Mark Sanchez <br><br> "<i>Win Forever</i>-it's not about wins and losses, it's about the competition within Pete's life. Reading his book, it's evident that he has a clear understanding that his job is more about creating an environment and foundation for young men that can better who they are every day on and off the field." <br> -Mia Hamm <br><br> "What impressed me about Pete is his contagious, positive approach and that his talents go far beyond what makes a great football coach. His philosophy of helping everyone be the best they can be makes sense in all aspects of everyday life. This will help everyone in our organization and will play a big part in defining the Seahawks' mindset and philosophy as we move forward." <br> -Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen <br><br> "If this book were just about football, it would be interesting but not compelling. Coach Carroll has something to say of importance to all of us who want to discover our potential as human beings. That he can win football games is beyond doubt, but that he can win over doubt itself is something special." <br> -Tim Gallwey, author of <i>The Inner Game of Tennis, The Inner Game of Work</i>, and <i>The Inner Game of Stress</i> <br><br> "Coach Carroll is one of the finest teachers in all of sport and one who I respect immensely. I'm just glad that he is now coaching in the NFL and not for our archrival anymore." <br> -John R. Wooden</p><h2>A Dawn Like Thunder: The True Story of Torpedo Squadron Eight</h2><p>One of the great untold stories of World War II finally comes to light in this thrilling account of Torpedo Squadron Eight and their heroic efforts in helping an outmatched U.S. fleet win critical victories at Midway and Guadalcanal. These 35 American men--many flying outmoded aircraft--changed the course of history, going on to become the war's most decorated naval air squadron, while suffering the heaviest losses in U.S. naval aviation history.<br>Mrazek paints moving portraits of the men in the squadron, and exposes a shocking cover-up that cost many lives. Filled with thrilling scenes of battle, betrayal, and sacrifice, A DAWN LIKE THUNDER<em> </em>is destined to become a classic in the literature of World War II.</p><p>Bob Mrazek is 62 years old and grew up in Huntington, N.Y.

From 1967-1968, he served in the U.S. Navy.<br><br> After working on the Washington staff of U.S. Senator Vance Hartke (D-Ind.), he was elected in 1982 to the U.S. Congress, defeating John Le Boutillier, the Republican incumbent in Long Island's "Gold Coast" district on the north shore of Long Island. Just the fourth freshman in the history of the House to be elected to the Appropriations Committee, he served ten years, announcing in 1991 that he would not stand for re-election.<br> In 1990 Bob Mrazek authored the law that saved the 17 million acre Tongass National Forest in Alaska from being clear-cut by the two largest pulp companies in the U.S. Mrazek also authored the Amerasian Homecoming Act, a law that brought more than 16,000 sons and daughters of American military personnel from lives as street children in Saigon to the U.S. Congressman Mrazek was also the original sponsor of the Landmark Preservation Act, a law that saved the Manassas Civil War battlefield from becoming a "mega-mall." He also wrote the National Film Preservation Act, a law that established the National Federal Registry of master film works in the Library of Congress, for which he received a career achievement award from the Director's Guild of America.<br><br> Mrazek was named Conservationist of the Year by the National Parks and Conservation Association and earned the Commissioner's Preservationist Award from the Governor of New York. Since his retirement from Congress, he has served on the boards of several charitable organizations, including ten years as Chairman of the Washington-based Alaska Wilderness League.

The squadron finished the war as the most decorated naval air squadron while suffering the highest losses in the Navy&#39;s aviation history. Its men are the focus of this work. Mrazek was able to track down those who survived and tells the human, as well as the military, history of the unit. Dick Hill gives this work an excellent reading. He easily performs the narrative and without missing a beat switches to a quote with an appropriate and believable accent, and then goes back to the narrative. His expressive and easygoing manner makes the art of narration seem effortless.

With his family--wife, young daughters and occasionally, mother-in-law--and household staff downstairs, the legendary dancer retreated to his room in a remote Swiss villa to tangle with his burgeoning psychosis. Fearful that his wife would (as she ultimately did) commit him, and highly suspicious of the physician-cum-amateur psychiatrist who daily came by to examine him, Nijinsky perceived the diary as the only safe haven for the rambling thoughts that were overtaking him. Throughout, the anxiety and anguish are palpable, as Nijinsky writes about his disillusionment with his mentor and lover, Ballets Russes director Serge Diaghilev; his alienation from and distrust of his closest family members; and his fear of insanity and its consequential confinement. His writing becomes more obscure as the weeks progress and he examines his relationship to God, writing "I am God" at one point, and later: "God said to me, 'Go home and tell your wife that you are mad.'" As his schizophrenia evolves, the pace and style of Nijinsky's prose changes radically--toward the end he writes in abstract verse--but he remains, with a dancer's sensibility, attuned to the cadences of his environment. The noises of the household, the ringing of the phone, footsteps down the hall, smatterings of conversations overheard are all registered as a sort of accompaniment to his dance with madness and function perhaps as a final tether to reality.<p> Nijinsky's wife stumbled upon the diary in a locked trunk some years after her husband disappeared into the abyss of madness and soon released it for publication to feed public interest in her famous mate--but not before she sanitized the manuscript to such a degree (removing references to his homosexuality, overblown ego, bizarre paranoia, and various obsessions with bodily functions and sex acts) that its essence was obscured. Now 80 years after it was written, 20 years after its renegade editor died, and six years after the copyright that Nijinsky's daughters held expired, the unexpurgated version of the diaries faithfully restores the fascinating record of a great artist's struggle for his life.</p><p>A uniquely personal record of a great artist&#x2019;s descent into madness</p><p>In his prime, Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950) was the most celebrated man in Western ballet--a virtuoso and a dramatic dancer such as European and American audiences had never seen before. After his triumphs in such works as The Specter of the Rose and Petrouchka, he set out to make ballets of his own, and with his Afternoon of a Faun and The Rite of Spring, created within a year of each other, he became ballet&#x2019;s first modernist choreographer. Then, still in his twenties, he began to go mad.</p><p>For six weeks in early 1919, as his tie to reality was giving way, Nijinsky kept a diary--the only sustained daily record we have, by a major artist, of the experience of entering psychosis. In some entries he is filled with hope. He is God; he will save the world. In other entries, he falls into a black despair. He is dogged by sexual obsessions, and by grief over World War I. Furthermore, he is afraid that he is going insane.</p><p>The diary was first published in 1936, in a version heavily bowdlerized by Nijinsky&#x2019;s wife. The new edition, translated by Kyril FitzLyon, is the first complete and accurate English rendering of this searing document. In her introduction, the noted dance critic Joan Acocella tells Nijinsky&#x2019;s story and places it in the context of early European modernism.</p></p><h2>100 Bullets Vol. 6: Six Feet Under the Gun</h2><p>Reprinting 100 BULLETS #37-42, this sixth trade paperback features six stand-alone chapters, each focused on one of the story&#39;s main players: Dizzy, Cole, Benito, Lono, Graves, and Wylie.

He is the author of <i>Jonny Double, Batman: Broken City</i>, and the Harvey and Eisner Award-winning <i>100 Bullets</i>, all created in collaboration with artist Eduardo Risso. Azzarello&#x2019;s other work for DC includes <i>Hellblazer</i> and <i>Loveless</i> with Marcelo Frusin; <i>Dark Knight III: The Master Race</i> with Frank Miller, Andy Kubert, and Klaus Janson; <i>Superman: For Tomorrow</i> with Jim Lee; <i>Joker</i> and <i>Luthor</i> with Lee Bermejo; <i>Sgt. Rock: Between Hell and A Hard Place</i> with Joe Kubert; <i>Filthy Rich</i> with Victor Santos; and most recently the all-new ongoing series <i>Wonder Woman</i> with Cliff Chiang.Imagine being dreadfully injured, yet uncertain of what happened or how to proceed. Imagine then being approached by Agent Graves, a craggy-faced old man with the eyes of a patient predator, who offers selected victims a gun, 100 untraceable bullets and a convincing dossier about whomever betrayed them. Early issues of this monthly comic concentrated on individuals' reactions to Graves's invitation to commit murder. Now, however, it's become clear that the "gift" isn't quite free; Graves is directing his vengeance seekers in a complicated scheme. The independent short stories here focus on people whose lives are affected more or less directly by Graves and his possible ally. The discontinuity between stories isn't bothersome; the comic brilliantly sustains a sense of nervous doubt. All that readers can be sure of so far is the basic human condition: people yearn, kill and die. Writer Azzarello is especially deft at presenting a multi-ethnic, street-level cast and at setting up images that almost connect, suggesting that the parts of the action do relate in ways readers can't quite grasp yet. And Risso nicely pictures those images in ways that are simultaneously scary and seductive. It's easy to create a threatening atmosphere in a claustrophobic Manhattan bar, but Risso can make even sunny Miami streets look menacing. He's also excellent at giving characters a distinctive look, although they do tend to flash the same feral leer. Even readers who haven't read earlier collections of this comic can pick up this book and enjoy the glossy surface and tantalizing hints of clues. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book is peopled with characters ranging from Marco Polo to Madame de Pompadour to P.T. Barnum. Profuse illustrations conjure the visions of Watteau and Boucher, pot painters in Delft and Minton, garden and kiosk designers from England to Poland, and creators of 1920s movie palaces--the style&#39;s final incarnation. Tracing the history of commerce as well as the image, chapters cover the time when intercontinental travel and trade were difficult if not impossible, the flowering of French rococo chinoiserie and its spread across 18th-century Europe. It also looks at the jardin anglo-chinois, the descendants of originally aristocratic styles in middle-class English and American homes, and finally the withering of the fantastic Cathay as more reliable information and objects arrived in the West from China in the 19th and 20th centuries. Should you be curious about the intricately carved dragon on a theater ceiling or wallpaper peopled with &#34;monkeys dressed as Chinamen,&#34; this smartly designed book written with verve, a love of the subject, and an insider&#39;s point of view provides a jumping-off point for further study and includes a list of places to visit. --Alex Lawrence</p><p>It was in the 17th century that myths of exotic &#34;Cathay&#34; began to be replaced by more definite knowledge of things Chinese, through the activities of English and Dutch traders. In the 18th century, however, the taste for designs and architecture based on ideas of Chinese design - &#34;Chinoiserie&#34; - became highly fashionable in the French court, and in its many imitators throughout Europe. Ever since, Chinoiserie has been a factor in the decorative arts and interiors throughout Europe and America. This book celebrates the flowering of the style, and, through over 200 images, shows its development through the 19th and into the 20th century. Packed with colour, the book creates a visual source for all those involved with interiors, collecting, architecture and design.Dawn Jacobson is a writer and lecturer on the fine and decorative arts.</p><h2>Mexico: The Beautiful Cookbook</h2><p>Mexico the Beautiful Cookbook captures the fascinating culinary heritage of Mexico in one stunning volume.

This book is special for two reasons. It's message of grace is powerful and profound - this is the kind of book you want to pass on to others.

His passion for this book clearly shines thorugh in every page. With Riven, Jenkins is at the top of his game. <p>From Jeff Johnson - C.O.O. <br>What an incredible story! Over the last week, I have grabbed whatever time I could to keep learning about and learning from the characters in your story. I even grabbed 15 minutes before going to church yesterday and was moved to tears as I read about the revival in the prison. As my wife said to me last night, "That book must have been good. You don't usually read a book that fast." I know I had a least four conversations yesterday with people telling them that this was a book that they had to read, and this morning at breakfast I told other members of the Executive Team that I was so excited about the ministry potential of this book. I Jerry receives thousands of letters from people stating how their hearts were touched from the words you put together. It will be great to see how God uses this book in the months and years ahead. I think it has all the ingredients to become a classic.</p><b>"This is the novel I have always wanted to write.</b> I determine whether a fiction idea has merit by how long it stays with me. Does it rattle in my brain, and do I find myself telling it to my wife and other confidants? Is it the type of a tale that will draw me back to the keyboard every day? Two-thirds of my published books have been novels, and only three have had that effect on me. I give my all to every one, but special joy and anticipation attend those that genuinely feel like the best ideas. <i>Riven</i> is my fourth such labor of love. The two main characters have remained in my memory since high school 40 years ago. The story idea is perhaps 20 years old.

He discusses how the approaching death of an artist can make its way &#x201c;with anachronism and anomaly&#x201d; into his work, as was the case in the late work of Thomas Mann, Richard Strauss, Jean Genet, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, and C. P. Cavafy. Said examines Beethoven&#x2019;s <i>Missa Solemnis,</i> Genet&#x2019;s <i>Le captif amoureux</i> and <i>Les paravents,</i> Mozart&#x2019;s <i>Cos� fan tutte,</i> Visconti&#x2019;s film of Lampedusa&#x2019;s <i>The Leopard,</i> Euripides&#x2019; <i>The Bacchae</i> and <i>Iphigenia at Aulis,</i> and Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Death in Venice,</i> among other works.<br><br>He points out that one can also find an &#x201c;unearthly serenity,&#x201d; in last works, for example, in Sophocles, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Matisse, Bach, and Wagner, which, as Said puts it, &#x201c;crown a lifetime of aesthetic endeavor.&#x201d; But in <i>On Late Style</i> he concentrates on artistic lateness as &#x201c;intransigence, difficulty, and unresolved contradiction.&#x201d; He also writes about Theodor Adorno and about Glenn Gould, who chose to stop performing, thereby creating his own form of lateness. Said makes clear that most of the works discussed are rife with deep conflict and an almost impenetrable complexity. In fact, he feels that lateness is often &#x201c;a form of exile.&#x201d; These works frequently stood in direct contrast to what was popular at the time, but they were forerunners of what was to come in each artist&#x2019;s particular discipline&#x2014;works of true genius.<br><br>Eloquent and impassioned, brilliantly reasoned and revelatory, <i>On Late Style</i> is Edward Said&#x2019;s own great last work.</p><p><b>Edward W. Said</b> was the author of more than twenty books; a regular contributor to newspapers in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East; and music critic for <i>The Nation.</i> He was also an accomplished pianist who collaborated with Daniel Barenboim and Yo-Yo Ma. Born in Jerusalem, he lived most of his adult life in New York City. He died in 2003.Timeliness and Lateness<br><br> The relationship between bodily condition and aesthetic style seems at first to be a subject so irrelevant and perhaps even trivial by comparison with the momentousness of life, mortality, medical science, and health, as to be quickly dismissed. Nevertheless, my contention is as follows: all of us, by virtue of the simple fact of being conscious, are involved in constantly thinking about and making something of our lives, self-making being one of the bases of history, which according to Ibn Khaldun and Vico, the great founders of the science of history, is essentially the product of human labor.<br><br> The important distinction therefore is that between the realm of nature on the one hand and secular human history on the other. The body, its health, its care, composition, functioning, and flourishing, its illnesses and demise, belong to the order of nature; what we understand of that nature, however, how we see and live it in our consciousness, how we create a sense of our life individually and collectively, subjectively as well as socially, how we divide it into periods, belongs roughly speaking to the order of history that when we reflect on it we can recall, analyze, and meditate on, constantly changing its shape in the process. There are all sorts of connections between the two realms, between history and nature, but for now I want to keep them apart and focus only on one of them, history.<br><br> Being myself a profoundly secular person, I have for years been studying this self-making process through three great problematics, three great human episodes common to all cultures and traditions, and it is the third of these problematics that I want specifically to discuss in this book. But for purposes of clarity, let me quickly summarize one and two. The first is the whole notion of beginning, the moment of birth and ori- gin, which in the context of history is all the material that goes into thinking about how a given process, its establishment and institution, life, project, and so on, gets started. Thirty years ago I published a book called Beginnings: Intention and Method about how the mind finds it necessary at certain times to retrospectively locate a point of origin for itself as to how things begin in the most elementary sense with birth. In fields like history and the study of culture, memory and retrospec- tion draw us to the onset of important things&#x2014;for example, the beginnings of industrialization, of scientific medicine, of the romantic period, and so on. Individually, the chronology of discovery is as important for a scientist as it is for someone like Immanuel Kant who reads David Hume for the first time and, he says memorably, is briskly awakened from his dogmatic slumber. In Western literature, the form of the novel is coincidental with the emergence of the bourgeoisie in the late seventeenth century, and this is why, for its first century, the novel is all about birth, possible orphanhood, the discovery of roots, and the creation of a new world, a career, and society. Robinson Crusoe. Tom Jones. Tristram Shandy.<br><br> To locate a beginning in retrospective time is to ground a project (such as an experiment, or a governmental commission, or Dickens&#x2019;s beginning to write Bleak House) in that moment, which is always subject to revision. Beginnings of this sort necessarily involve an intention that either is fulfilled, totally or in part, or is viewed as totally failed, in successive time. And so the second great problematic is about the continuity that occurs after birth, the exfoliation from a beginning: in the time from birth to youth, reproductive generation, maturity. Every culture offers and circulates images of what has been wonderfully called the dialectic of incarnation, or in Fran�ois Jacob&#x2019;s phrase, la logique du vivant. Again to give examples from the history of the novel (the Western aesthetic form that offers the largest and most complex image of ourselves that we have), there is the bildungsroman or novel of education, the novel of idealism and disappointment (L&#x2019;Education sentimentale, Les Illusions perdues), the novel of immaturity and community (like George Eliot&#x2019;s Middlemarch, which the English critic Gillian Beer has shown was powerfully influenced by what she calls Dar- win&#x2019;s plots for the patterns of generation that structure this great novel of nineteenth-century British society). Other aesthetic forms, in music and painting, follow similar patterns.<br><br> But there are also exceptions, examples of deviation from the overall assumed pattern to human life. One thinks of Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels, Crime and Punishment, and The Trial, works that seem to break away from the amazingly persistent underlying compact between the notion of the successive ages of man (as in Shakespeare) and aesthetic reflections of and on them. For it bears saying explicitly that both in art and in our general ideas about the passage of human life there is assumed to be a general abiding timeliness, by which I mean that what is appropriate to early life is not appropriate for later stages, and vice versa. You will recall, for example, the stern biblical observation that to everything there is a season and a time, to every purpose under the heaven, a time to be born, and a time to die, and so on: &#x201c;wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? . . . All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean.&#x201d;<br><br> In other words, we assume that the essential health of a human life has a great deal to do with its correspondence to its time, the fitting together of one to the other, and therefore its appropriateness or timeliness. Comedy, for instance, seeks its material in untimely behavior, an old man falling in love with a young woman (May in December), as in Moli�re and Chaucer, a philosopher acting like a child, a well person feigning illness. But it is also comedy as a form that brings about the restoration of timeliness through the kommos with which the work usually concludes, the marriage of young lovers.<br><br> I come finally to the last great problematic, which for obvious personal reasons is my subject here&#x2014;the last or late period of life, the decay of the body, the onset of ill health or other factors that even in a younger person bring on the possibility of an untimely end. I shall focus on great artists and how near the end of their lives their work and thought acquires a new idiom, what I shall be calling a late style.<br><br> Does one grow wiser with age, and are there unique qualities of perception and form that artists acquire as a result of age in the late phase of their career? We meet the accepted notion of age and wisdom in some last works that reflect a special maturity, a new spirit of reconciliation and serenity often expressed in terms of a miraculous transfiguration of common reality. In late plays such as The Tempest or The Winter&#x2019;s Tale, Shakespeare returns to the forms of romance and parable; similarly, in Sophocles&#x2019; Oedipus at Colonus, the aged hero is portrayed as having finally attained a remarkable holiness and sense of resolution. Or there is the well-known case of Verdi who, in his final years, produced Othello and Falstaff, works that exude not so much a spirit of wise resignation as a renewed, almost youthful energy that attests to an apotheosis of artistic creativity and power.<br><br> Each of us can readily supply evidence of how it is that late works crown a lifetime of aesthetic endeavor. Rembrandt and Matisse, Bach and Wagner. But what of artistic lateness not as harmony and resolution but as intransigence, difficulty, and unresolved contradiction? What if age and ill health don&#x2019;t produce the serenity of &#x201c;ripeness is all&#x201d;? This is the case with Ibsen, whose final works, especially When We Dead Awaken, tear apart the career and the artist&#x2019;s craft and reopen the questions of meaning, success, and progress that the artist&#x2019;s late period is supposed to move beyond. Far from resolution, then, Ibsen&#x2019;s last plays suggest an angry and disturbed artist for whom the medium of drama provides an occasion to stir up more anxiety, tamper irrevocably with the possibility of closure, and leave the audience more perplexed and unsettled than before.<br><br> It is this second type of lateness as a factor of style that I find deeply interesting. I&#x2019;d like to explore the experience of late style that involves a nonharmonious, nonserene tension, and above all, a sort of deliberately unproductive productiveness going against. . . .<br><br> Adorno used the phrase &#x201c;late style&#x201d; most memorably in an essay fragment entitled &#x201c;Sp�tstil Beethovens,&#x201d; dated 1937 and included in a 1964 collection of musical essays, Moments musicaux, then again in Essays on Music, a posthumously published (1993) book on Beethoven. For Adorno, far more than for anyone who has spoken of Beethoven&#x2019;s last works, those compositions that belong to what is known as the composer&#x2019;s third period (the last five piano sonatas, the Ninth Symphony, the Missa Solemnis, the last six string quartets, the seventeen bagatelles for piano) constitute an event in the history of modern culture: a moment when the artist who is fully in command of his medium nevertheless abandons communication with the established social order of which he is a part and achieves a contradictory, alienated relationship with it. His late works constitute a form of exile. One of Adorno&#x2019;s most extraordinary essays, included in the same collection with the late-style fragment, is on the Missa Solemnis, which he calls an alienated masterpiece (verfremdetes Hauptwerk) by virtue of its difficulty, its archaisms, and i...</p><h2>The Cannibal Galaxy</h2><p>Joseph Brill, the headmaster of his own school and creator of its curriculum, believes he has found in Hester Lilt a kindred mind and spirit, but Hester rejects Brill when he fails to appreciate her daughter, who is Brill&#39;s student</p><p></p><h2>Cold Blooded (A Bentz/Montoya Novel)</h2><p><b>His Vengeance Will Be Repeated.&nbsp; .&nbsp; . </b><br><br>A woman's slashed, incinerated corpse is found in a seedy New Orleans apartment.

A single mother, she is a native of Oregon,where she still resides with her two teenage sons.Lisa is often asked what is the key to her success, and her unfailinganswer is a keen imagination, incredible friends, loving family, andalways, loads of laughter. As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said,&#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;Another serial killer is wreaking havoc in New Orleans, and it's up to detectives Rick Bentz and Reuben Montoya, the protagonists from Jackson's previous thriller, Hot Blooded, to reign him in. This time around, the detectives are joined by Olivia Benchet, a reluctant psychic who hails from a highly dysfunctional family. Olivia's visions of a priestly killer who tortures and sacrifices young females provide Bentz and Montoya with their best clues, but Olivia may be the next victim if Bentz doesn't shrug off his cynicism concerning visions and romantic entanglements with the wild-haired psychic. Twice burned by his former wife, who had an affair with his half-brother, Bentz now lives for work and his rebellious, 19-year-old daughter, Kristi. The hunt for the murderer escalates when Olivia realizes her visions are a two-way mirror, and the killer has Kristi and Olivia in his sights. Jackson's sanctimonious serial killer, who refers to himself as The Chosen One, is stock, but the dynamics between her protagonists, particularly between Bentz and Olivia, are a welcome counterpoint to the violent action. Although some readers may be repulsed by the killer's sexually sadistic crimes, which are depicted in graphic detail,others will be intrigued by Jackson's portrayal of the grotesqueries that result when faith and family are perverted. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lost Files of Nancy Drew</h2><p>This stunning, interactive book is narrated by Nancy Drew herself.

After months of <br>violent disorders throughout Russia, the revolution was under way; <br>and as the majority members (Bolsheviki) of the Socialist Party <br>believed in "dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasants," <br>thousands of wealthy landowners and businessmen realized their lands <br>and businesses would be confiscated, and fled the country with all <br>the money and possessions they could take with them. Supporters <br>and/or relatives of Tsar Nicholas II (government ministers, army <br>officers, princes and grand dukes with their wives and children) also <br>took flight, and when fighting between Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik <br>forces erupted across the country, thousands more fled their homes to <br>become refugees from a savage and devastating civil war.<br><br>Among the refugees were two families, one rich, one poor, living <br>three thousand miles apart. A daughter of the rich family and a son <br>of the poor family eventually emigrated to California, met in San <br>Francisco, and were married on February 8, 1938. The Russian Orthodox <br>ceremony took place at the Russian church on Fulton Street, when the <br>bride was almost five months pregnant, and the following July a <br>future star was born.<br><br>In 1917, Stepan Zudilov was forty-two years old, a portly, prosperous <br>middle-class businessman who owned soap and candle factories in <br>Barnaul, southern Siberia, and an estate in the outlying countryside. <br>By then he had fathered a large family: two sons and two daughters by <br>his first wife, who died in 1905 after giving birth to their younger <br>daughter; and by his second wife, whom he married a year later, two <br>more daughters followed by two more sons.<br><br>His youngest daughter, Maria Stepanovna, born in 1912, claimed years <br>later in California that her mother came from an aristocratic family <br>with Romanov connections, and had "married beneath her." But this was <br>Maria the fabulist speaking, with her dreams of nobility, and Zudilov <br>the outspoken tsarist and land-and-factory owner had no need of <br>Romanov connections to qualify for the Bolshevik hit list. The <br>Zudilovs were known as "gentry," and to the Bolsheviks all landowning <br>gentry were suspect, like the family of the great Russian writer Ivan <br>Bunin (who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1933). "Any of us <br>who had the slightest chance to escape did so," Bunin wrote after he <br>fled from his estate in central Russia to France by way of Romania.<br><br>But the armies of the new government headed by Lenin were slow to <br>gain control of an enormous country, and for almost a year the <br>Zudilovs, like their tsarist neighbors, were in no imminent danger by <br>remaining in Barnaul. It was not until the summer of 1918, six months <br>after the civil war broke out, that the Bolsheviks managed to gain <br>control of all southern and central Russia. On the night of July 16, <br>Tsar Nicholas II, his entire family, their doctor and servants, were <br>executed by a squad of Red Guards at Ekaterinburg, the western <br>terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway. When the news reached <br>Barnaul, it sent tremors of fear throughout the neighboring gentry; <br>and by late November, Red Guard units were only a hundred miles from <br>the town, after executing suspected tsarists en route.<br><br>Zudilov had arranged to be warned of their approach in advance, and <br>when the alert came, the family hurried to a prepared hiding place on <br>the estate, stuffing as much money and jewelry as they could inside <br>loose-fitting peasant clothes.

Maria <br>claimed later that they traveled by private train, with a retinue of <br>servants as well as stacks of rubles and the family jewels stowed in <br>their luggage. Although there's no doubt they escaped with enough <br>assets to live very comfortably in exile, the private train is almost <br>certainly another example of Maria the fabulist.<br><br>Red Guards were still searching the area for potential enemies of the <br>new Soviet Russia, and a private train would have aroused immediate <br>suspicion. But as Barnaul was a stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway, <br>only four hundred miles from the Manchurian frontier, and Harbin the <br>last stop before Vladivostok for eastbound trains, it seems far more <br>likely that the Zudilovs decided to keep a low profile and traveled <br>by the regular route.<br><br>When the child from a secluded country estate looked out the train <br>window during that journey of almost three thousand miles, she would <br>have glimpsed the same frighteningly alien world as the Anglo-Russian <br>novelist William Gerhardie, who traveled by the Trans-Siberian that <br>same year. He saw a "stricken land of misery," with ravenous and <br>spectral refugees huddled on the platform when the train slowed down <br>past a wayside station; dismal tracts of frozen steppe, occasionally <br>swept by a violent gale that caused the coaches to rattle, squeal, <br>and shudder; and near the Chinese frontier, where civil war had been <br>especially ferocious, a wake of gutted villages and more desperate <br>refugees, some dying or dead.<br><br>Ivan Bunin: No one who did not actually witness it can comprehend <br>what the Russian Revolution quickly turned into. The spectacle was <br>sheer terror for anyone who had not utterly lost sight of God.<br><br>Like thousands of other refugees, Zudilov chose Harbin because it was <br>a Chinese city with a strong Russian presence. The Byzantine dome of <br>the Russian cathedral dominated its skyline, and there was an <br>extensive Russian quarter, part business, part residential, with <br>street signs in Russian, droshkies instead of rickshaws, restaurants <br>that served borscht and beef Stroganoff. Japan had also moved in, <br>with trading concessions at the port on the Songhua River, <br>investments in the city's grain mills, and a chain of "Happiness <br>Mansions," brothels that featured very young boys as well as girls; <br>and Britain, with the British Export Company, which employed <br>ruthlessly underpaid Chinese to slaughter thousands of pigs, fowl and <br>sheep every year, then freeze them for export to the homeland and the <br>United States.<br><br>Business as usual, of course, meant politics as usual, colonial <br>expansion in a country weakened by years of internal rebellions led <br>by rival warlords. By the spring of 1918, Russian nationals formed <br>almost a third of Harbin's population of three hundred thousand, and <br>the Chinese quarter was just a suburb, like a picturesque Chinatown <br>set in a Hollywood silent movie; while the much larger central <br>downtown area, with its handsome beaux-arts railroad station and <br>Hotel Moderne, looked solidly Western. Under the agreement between <br>Russia and China, the stretch of the Trans-Siberian that crossed <br>Manchuria was officially known as the Chinese Eastern Railway; but it <br>was Russian-financed, maintained by Russian workers, and guarded by <br>regiments of Russian soldiers headquartered in Harbin.<br><br>And in the wake of the revolution, the Zudilovs escaped one political <br>upheaval only to find themselves in the middle of another. Not long <br>before they arrived, fighting had broken out between Red and White <br>Russian workers and guards on the railway. The Soviet government had <br>sent in militiamen to rout the anti-Bolsheviks; and in case a <br>full-scale civil war developed, the Japanese made ready to invade <br>Manchuria and seize control of the Chinese Eastern. At the end of <br>December, when the Zudilovs reached Harbin, the Chinese government <br>intervened by sending in an army to disarm and deport the Soviet <br>militia; and for the moment at least, the situation was defused.<br><br>A few weeks later, on February 8, 1919, the Zudilovs celebrated <br>Maria's seventh birthday. Although she was too young, of course, to <br>understand the ways of the great world, the flight from Barnaul had <br>stamped images of warning and terror on her mind. Like most Russian <br>refugees, the Zudilovs stayed within their own community of exiles, <br>ignoring China and the Chinese; but as she grew up, Maria couldn't <br>fail to notice-beyond the house in the Russian quarter where Zudilov <br>established his family with a Chinese cook and a German nanny for the <br>girls, and the Russian school where she occasionally took ballet <br>lessons as well as regular classes-more warning signs that the great <br>world was a disturbingly insecure place.<br><br>Throughout the 1920s, the city witnessed several outbreaks of <br>fighting between Red and White Russians, parades of underpaid Chinese <br>workers on strike against foreign companies, and street <br>demonstrations by the growing nationalist movement. In 1920 one of <br>these demonstrations led to violence, and smoke covered the city when <br>the storage plant of the British Export Company was burned to the <br>ground. Occasional Soviet threats to invade Manchuria and restore <br>order sent shivers of alarm through the exiles; and an increasingly <br>familiar experience for Maria was the sight of Russians who had <br>arrived in style, like her own family, reduced to begging in the <br>streets when their money ran out.<br><br>The sight of her half-brother hanging from a tr...</p><h2>Steve McQueen, the Final Chapter</h2><p>Few stars guarded their private lives as zealously as Steve McQueen. He was a loner. untrustmg, scarred by events that shaped his formative years. Reporters found him difficult to corner; photographers frequently gave up the chase, Yet, throughout a legendary career he was rarely out of the headlines. The public loved this ruggedly handsome man of explosive temperament and gritty independence. In time he became the new hero of a generation, one of the most successful and popular stars in the world. Still, he remained unreachable. No one had been able to capture the real Steve McQueen prior to this book. In THE FINAL CHAPTER Grady Ragsdale tells of his close personal and working relationship with the magnetic superstar during the happiest and darkest of times. Theirs was a special friendship. Told with complete candor, here is the incredible story of the last year of McQueen&#39;s life, starting in 1979 with his escape from the fast-paced, artificial Hollywood scene to start a new, simpler life among the people and surroundings he loved, through his long and courageous bout against cancer. This is the true story that had been -- until this book -- only speculation. Every detail is documented, including his passion for flying old airplanes, his wedding under armed guard to beautiful model Barbara Minty, his controversial holistic medical treatment in Mexico, and his secret meeting with Dr. Billy Graham. The photos were gathered from McQueen&#39;s personal favorites, given to Grady Ragsdale by the actor. THE FINAL CHAPTER is more than a biography. It is an intimate portrait, a memoir of a man of unique strength and determination, one who spent his entire life searching for happiness, and found it in an expected source. THE FINAL CHAPTER is revealing, heartwarming and inspirational.</p><p></p><h2>Advanced Pressure Point Grappling</h2><p>Easy to read and follow instruction on the life-saving art of pressure point self-defense.</p><p>George A. Dillman, a 9th degree black belt in Ryukyu Kempo Tomari-te, recently honored by Black Belt Magazine as &#x201c; 1997--Instructor of the Year&#x201d; is one of the U.S.A.&#x2019;s best known and well-established martial arts personalities. Dillman came to the attention of the martial arts press when he began competing in the early 1960&#x2019;s. By the end of that decade, he had started running his own tournament, called the Northeast Open Karate Championships. This competition was held annually-- the first kicking off in Palmer Park, Maryland in 1966. The site was moved to Suitland Maryland in 1967, and moved again to Reading, PA in 1968 where it was held until 1996. <p>Official Karate magazine (Nov.1982), described Dillman as, &#x201c;one of the winningest competitors karate has ever known.&#x201d; Dillman was four-times National Karate Champion (1969-1972) and during this period was consistently ranked among top ten competitors in the nation by major karate magazines. During his nine-year competitive career, Dillman claimed a total of 327 trophies in fighting, forms, breaking, and weapons. </p><p>Dillman began serious martial arts training in 1961 with Harry G. Smith. He went on to study with Daniel K. Pai, James Coffman, Sam Pearson, Robert Trias and Seiyu Oyata. Dillman has always considered himself a student, never a master of the martial arts. To this end he and his wife and students have traveled throughout the United States to meet and train with various martial arts experts. </p><p>Because of his perseverance, Dillman&#x2019;s martial arts talents have earned him widespread U.S. media coverage. He has appeared on 35 National TV shows, including: Real People, Mike Douglas, PM Magazine, Evening Magazine, and NBC&#x2019;s Sports Machine. Dillman has also been featured five times in Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not, and has been the subject of over 300 newspaper and magazine articles. Dillman, who was a professional boxer for three and one half years, is the only person known to have trained with both Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali. In May of 1988. Dillman was inducted into the Berks County Sports Hall of Fame. He was the first martial artist to be included. </p><p>Currently, Dillman travels the world teaching seminars on pressure points and tuite (grappling) hidden within the traditional movements of the old martial arts forms. It is his research and scientific dissection of the old forms that is earning him his most notoriety. Never one to shy away from controversy, Dillman has rediscovered a formerly secret level of meaning for kata movements, and has made that interpretation understandable to all. He has produced a video tape instructional series on the pressure points, and has written six books with Chris Thomas: Kyusho-Jitsu: The Dillman Method of Pressure Point Fighting; Advanced Pressure Point Fighting of Ryukyu Kempo; Advanced Pressure Point Grappling: Tuite; Pressure Point Karate Made Easy; Humane Pressure Point Self-Defense; and Little Jay Learns Karate. The books have been said to be,&#x201d; the definitive martial arts books of the century,&#x201d; and &#x201c;unparalleled among current martial arts literature.&#x201d; </p><p>Dillman is the chief instructor for Dillman Karate International, an organization of over 85 schools worldwide, with an enrollment of nearly 15,000 students. He has studied under five 10th degree black belts from Okinawa and is currently furthering his personal study through research, practice, and the sharing of techniques with Prof. Remy Presas ( Modern Arnis) and Prof. Wally Jay (Small Circle Jujitsu). </p><p>Chris Thomas has studied karate since 1970, and holds a black belt ranking in three separate styles: Shotokan, Isshinryu, and Ryukyu Kempo Tomari-te. Thomas is a widely published and respected authority on martial arts whose works have appeared in martial arts periodicals world-wide.</p></p><h2>Cross Game, Vol. 7 (7)</h2><p><b>This poignant coming-of-age story will change your perception of what shonen manga can be.

As sceptical observer on family motoring holidays, assistant in a school in Brittany, student of the language and literature, author of Flaubert's Parrot and Cross Channel, he has criss-crossed the country and its culture.<br>The essays collected here, written over a twenty-year period, attest to his clear-eyed appreciation of the Land Without Brussels Sprouts. He ranges widely, from landscape to literature, food to Flaubert, film and song to the Tour de France. His humour, timing and intelligence never falter. When Picador published his Letters from London, the Financial Times called him 'our finest essayist'. Something to Declare confirms that judgment: it is a great literary delight.</p><p>Julian Barnes's long and passionate relationship with la belle France began more than forty years ago, and in these essays on the country and the culture he combines a keen appreciation, a seemingly infinite sphere of reference, and prose as stylish as classic haute couture.<br><br>Barnes's vision of France-"The Land Without Brussels Sprouts"-embraces its vanishing peasantry; its vanished hyper-literate pop singers, Georges Brassens, Boris Vian, and Jacques Brel ("[he] sang at the world as if it... could be saved from its follies and brutalities by his vocal embrace"); and the gleeful iconoclasm of its nouvelle vague cinema ("'The Underpass in Modern French Film' is a thesis waiting to be written"). <br><br>He describes the elegant tour of France that Henry James and Edith Wharton made in 1907, and the orgy of drugs and suffering of the Tour de France in our own time. An unparalleled connoisseur of French writing and writers, Barnes gives us his thoughts on the prolific and priapic Simenon, on Sand, Baudelaire, and Mallarm� ("If literature is a spectrum, and Hugo hogs the rainbow, then Mallarm� is working in ultra-violet"). <br><br>In several dazzling excursions into the prickly genius of Flaubert, Barnes discusses his letters; his lover Louise Colet; and his biographers (Sartre's The Family Idiot, "an intense, unfinished, three-volume growl at Flaubert, is mad, of course"). He delves into Flaubert's friendship with Turgenev; looks at the "faithful betrayal" of Claude Chabrol's film version of Madame Bovary; and reveals the importance of the pharmacist's assistant, the most major minor character in Flaubert's great novel: "if Madame Bovary were a mansion, Justin would be the handle to the back door; but great architects have the design of door-furniture in mind even as they lay out the west wing."<br><br>For lovers of France and all things French-and of Julian Barnes's singular wit and intelligence-Something to Declare is an unadulterated joy to read.&#x201c;Beautifully written. . . .

Byzantine art is both static and dynamic: static in the sense that once an image was established it was felt that no improvement was necessary; dynamic in the sense that there was never one style and these styles or modes were constantly changing. The story is not only complex in its unravelling but ranges widely over various media: mosaic, wall painting and painted panels, sculpture in marble and ivory, manuscript illumination, gold, silver, and precious stones, jewellery, silk and rich vestments. This is an account by a medieval art-historian.</p><p></p><h2>The Hero With a Thousand Faces (Bollingen Series, No. 17)</h2><p><p>Joseph Campbell's classic cross-cultural study of the hero's journey has inspired millions and opened up new areas of research and exploration. Originally published in 1949, the book hit the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list in 1988 when it became the subject of <i>The Power of Myth</i>, a PBS television special.</p><br><p>The first popular work to combine the spiritual and psychological insights of modern psychoanalysis with the archetypes of world mythology, the book creates a roadmap for navigating the frustrating path of contemporary life. Examining heroic myths in the light of modern psychology, it considers not only the patterns and stages of mythology but also its relevance to our lives today--and to the life of any person seeking a fully realized existence.</p><br><p>Myth, according to Campbell, is the projection of a culture's dreams onto a large screen; Campbell's book, like <i>Star Wars</i>, the film it helped inspire, is an exploration of the big-picture moments from the stage that is our world. It is a must-have resource for both experienced students of mythology and the explorer just beginning to approach myth as a source of knowledge.</p></p><p>Originally written by Campbell in the &#39;40s-- in his pre-Bill Moyers days -- and famous as George Lucas&#39; inspiration for &#34;Star Wars,&#34; this book will likewise inspire any writer or reader in its well considered assertion that while all stories have already been told, this is *not* a bad thing, since the *retelling* is still necessary. And while our own life&#39;s journey must always be ended alone, the travel is undertaken in the company not only of immediate loved ones and primal passion, but of the heroes and heroines -- and myth-cycles -- that have preceded us."I have returned to no book more often since leaving college than this one, and every time I discover new insight into the human journey. Every generation will find in Hero wisdom for the ages."--Bill Moyers, host of the PBS special 'The Power of Myth' <p>"In the three decades since I discovered <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>, it has continued to fascinate and inspire me. Joseph Campbell peers through centuries and shows us that we are all connected by a basic need to hear stories and understand ourselves. As a book, it is wonderful to read; as illumination into the human condition, it is a revelation."--George Lucas, filmmaker, creator of the movie 'Star Wars'</p></p><h2>DK Handbooks: Insects</h2><p>These Dorling Kindersley Handbook titles have been updated, and given a fresh new look.

Nestle explores the fragile unions&#x201d; of contemporary lesbian life, both personal and historic.</p><p>A rich new collection by poet, historian, and lesbian activist Joan Nestle, ranging from meditations on her femme identity to arguments for a diversified college curriculum. Cofounder of the Lesbian Herstory Archives, which were housed for 20 years in her New York apartment, Nestle has made no clear division between her erotic and her political writings, a stance that has irritated many feminists. The archive itself is a ceaseless, passionate response to the first time that Nestle ever tried to "find out about" herself by writing a high school paper on homosexuality. She began her research at the New York Public Library, and in the card catalog "found the word <i>Homosexual</i>, followed by a dash and the words, <i>see Deviancy</i>, and next to this, <i>see Pathology</i>, with suggested subcategories of prisons and mental institutions." Her inclusive sensibilities have informed the acquisition policies of the archive, which has collected everything from pulp novels of the 1940s and 1950s to the diary of a lesbian prostitute to the pasties of a lesbian stripper. "If we ask decorous questions of history," Nestle argues, "we will get a genteel history." Essential reading in the social history of postwar America and the particular struggles of lesbians to be included in that history. <i>--Regina Marler</i>We were tremendously honored to be asked by Joan Nestle to publish A FRAGILE UNION, which is her most exquisite writing to date.

Rather it was the culmination of a campaign that began as soon as war was resumed in May 1803 and aimed ultimately at the invasion of Great Britain. To this end Napoleon attempted by ruse and elaborately disguised manoeuvres to bring his scattered and blockaded squadrons together for long enough to give him command of the Channel, which he fondly believed was all that was necessary to ensure a successful landing. Therefore, this period becomes a perfect demonstration of the workings of seapower and reveals that, however great a strategic genius on land, Napoleon never really grasped the principles of British maritime defense, gleaned as it was from over two hundred years&#x2019; experience. This is not to say that the invasion threat was treated lightly, although some of the rumored devices belong to the world of science fiction&#x2019; on the other hand the anti-invasion operations included the first use of such futuristic weapons as torpedoes and rockets. Little of the naval warfare of this period is not in some way connected with the main campaign, and this volume is devoted to the great wars of 1793-1815, charts all the major naval events of 1803 to 1805, including America&#x2019;s first full-bloodied naval war, with the Barbary States.</p><p>The general introductions are the work of Dr Roger Morriss, an expert on the naval administration and dockyards of this period, with other contributions from David Lyon, the well-known author of the most comprehensive listing of British sailing warships, The Sailing Navy List.

How can she prove she&#x2019;s not to blame?</p><p><b>Cate Tiernan</b> lives in Durham, North Carolina.Grade 9 Up-Here, Morgan is out of control-and just when things seem to be settling down. Even though she is a powerful witch, her newbie status makes the magick difficult to control. Violent episodes appear to follow her, and her friends think the events are her doing. But are they? Could Morgan's biological father really be the cause of the dark magick? Or is there another powerful witch who is blind to her own power? Characters continue to develop and the thrilling action continues to move the series along nicely. Especially good are the passages involving Morgan's family. Her parents' reluctance to accept their daughter's new religion is a realistic addition. Still confusing, however, are the mysterious diary entries circa 1971. Some of their content mirrors Morgan's struggles, but readers may not be able to reconcile the diary's presence within the text itself. Still, it does help sustain the overall foreboding mood. This ninth entry is too involved to stand alone, but fans of the series will enjoy it.<br><i>Elaine Baran Black, Gwinnett County Public Library, Lawrenceville, GA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Waste Lands</h2><p>Roland, the Last Gunslinger, is moving ever closer to the Dark Tower, which haunts his dreams and nightmares.

He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, in Bangor, Maine.<b>38</b> <p> JAKE HAD NO CLEAR memory of the time which followed, and that was probably merciful. He had left his world over a year before nine hundred people would commit suicide together in a small South American country called Guyana, but he knew about the periodic death-rushes of the lemmings, and what was happening in the disintegrating undercity of the Grays was like that. </p><p> There were explosions, some on their level but most far below them; acrid smoke occasionally drifted from the ventilator grilles, but most of the air-purifiers were still working and they whipped the worst of it away before it could gather in choking clouds. They saw no fires. Yet the Grays were reacting as if the time of the apocalypse had come. Most only fled, their faces blank O's of panic, but many had committed suicide in the halls and interconnected rooms through which the steel sphere led Roland and Jake. Some had shot themselves; many more had slashed their throats or wrists; a few appeared to have swallowed poison. On all the faces of the dead was the same expression of overmastering terror. Jake could only vaguely understand what had driven them to this. Roland had a better idea of what had happened to them-to their minds-when the long-dead city first came to life around them and then seemed to commence tearing itself apart. And it was Roland who understood that Blaine was doing it on purpose. That Blaine was driving them to it. </p><p> They ducked around a man hanging from an overhead heating-duct and pounded down a flight of steel stairs behind the floating steel ball. </p><p> "Jake!" Roland shouted. "You never let me in at all, did you?" </p><p> Jake shook his head. </p><p> "I didn't think so. It was Blaine." </p><p> They reached the bottom of the stairs and hurried along a narrow corridor toward a hatch with the words ABSOLUTELY NO ADMITTANCE printed on it in the spiked letters of the High Speech. </p><p> "Is it Blaine?" Jake asked. </p><p> "Yes-that's as good a name as any." </p><p> "What about the other v-" </p><p> "Hush!" Roland said grimly. </p><p> The steel ball paused in front of the hatchway. The wheel spun and the hatch popped ajar. Roland pulled it open, and they stepped into a huge underground room which stretched away in three directions as far as they could see. It was filled with seemingly endless aisles of control panels and electronic equipment. Most of the panels were still dark and dead, but as Jake and Roland stood inside the door, looking about with wide eyes, they could see pilot-lights coming on and hear machinery cycling up. </p><p> "The Tick-Tock Man said there were thousands of computers," Jake said. "I guess he was right. My God, look!" </p><p> Roland did not understand the word Jake had used and so said nothing. He only watched as row after row of panels lit up. A cloud of sparks and a momentary tongue of green fire jumped from one of the consoles as some ancient piece of equipment malfunctioned. </p><p> Most of the machinery, however, appeared to be up and running just fine.

Chronicling the years he spent as a bishop and later archbishop in Krakow, Poland through his election as the first Polish Pope in 1978, he recounts everything from communist efforts to suppress the church in Poland to his efforts to adopt a new and more open style of pastoral ministry. With recollections on his life as well as his thoughts on the issues facing the world now, Pope John Paul II offers words of wisdom in this book that will appeal to people of any faith looking to strengthen their spirituality.</p><p>Karol Wojtyla was born in Wadowice, Poland, on May 18, 1920. He was ordained a priest in 1946, and named auxiliary bishop of Krakow in 1958, and archbishop of Krakow in 1964. On October 16, 1978, he was elected Pope and assumed the name John Paul II. In 1994 he published, together with Vittorio Messori, Crossing the Threshold of Hope.The late pontiff continues the story of his pilgrimage, as begun in GIFT IN MEMORY, which covered his life up to his election as bishop in 1958. This work, which takes its title from Mark 14:42, begins with Karol's acceptance of the call to bishop and ends with his election as pope some twenty years later. Describing his life in this period, the late pope uses incidents and discussion of fellow members of Church hierarchy to illustrate his views of Christian vocation and how leadership is to be exercised in the Catholic Church. Kristoffer Tabori narrates with great skill. An Audie Award winner, he adroitly displays his talents here. His voice is deep, and his delivery is stately and dignified, yet expressive. His reading of the Polish names seems to be perfect. This is a superb match of reader and text.

But he was also brilliant, tenacious, and capable--in short, "the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street." Jenkins's book stands as the best single-volume biography of Churchill in recent years.<p> Marked by the author's wide experience writing on British leaders such as Balfour and Gladstone and his tenure as a member of Parliament, his book adds much to the vast library of works on Churchill. While acknowledging his subject's prickly nature, Jenkins credits Churchill for, among other things, recognizing far earlier than his peers the dangers of Hitler's regime. He praises Churchill for his leadership during the war years, especially at the outset, when England stood alone and in imminent danger of defeat. He also examines Churchill's struggle to forge political consensus to meet that desperate crisis, and he sheds new light on Churchill's postwar decline. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Former Home Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and President of the European Commission, Roy Jenkins is currently Chancellor of Oxford University and President of the Royal Society of Literature.

At last, New York Times bestselling author Alan Dean Foster returns to his acclaimed Humanx universe, where a young human orphan called Flinx seeks to unlock the dangerous secrets of his past and the uncertain prospects of his future with the aid of the formidable minidrag known as Pip. Together, Flinx and Pip have roamed the galaxy on their quest for knowledge, finding friends and enemies along the way, and providing unforgettable memories for an ever-growing legion of delighted fans. Now, with Reunion, Alan Dean Foster gives those fans what they've been clamoring for: the most mind-bending Flinx and Pip adventure yet--a roller-coaster ride into the unknown, filled with wonder and humor . . . and a host of deadly adversaries.<br><br>It all starts innocently enough. Well, almost innocently. So what if Flinx uses his enhanced empathic abilities to finesse his way into a top secret security installation on Earth? Once there, he bamboozles a sophisticated AI program into releasing classified information about the Meliorare Society, the sect of renegade eugenicists whose experiments with human beings had horrified the civilized universe more than twenty years ago. After all, as one of the few Meliorare experiments to survive, Flinx has a right to know about his past. Especially since his telepathic powers seem to be evolving. The question is, evolving into what? The excruciating headaches afflicting Flinx with increasing frequency make him wonder if he will be alive to find out.<br><br>But headaches are the least of his problems. For the information he uncovers leads Flinx into AAnn space, and the reptilian AAnn are more likely to eat human visitors than welcome them. Awaiting Flinx is a planet brimming with hidden dangers and astonishing discoveries. But nothing so dangerous, or so astonishing, as the unexpected return of an old enemy: an enemy as evil as she is beautiful . . .</p><p>After a long wait, fans of the adventures of Flinx of the Commonwealth finally get to rejoin the hero and his poisonous minidrag, Pip. In <i>Reunion</i>, Flinx travels from earth to AAnn space trying to unlock the secrets of his past. <p> Flinx is on earth to hunt down classified information about the Meliorare Society, the sect of renegade eugenicists responsible for his telepathic gifts. To get into a top-secret installation, he uses his powers to charm one of the key security people so he can gain access to their AI program. However, the file with the information he's looking for has been taken, and he barely escapes. </p><p> In an effort to hunt down the file, Flinx and Pip end up on a dangerous trek across the galaxy into the heart of AAnn space. When their shuttle crashes on a desert planet, Flinx and the minidrag soon find themselves up against native dangers and a nest of reptilian AAnn soldiers. But that's only the beginning for Flinx, because before it's over he will discover an ancient mystery and face an old foe who may turn out to be his most dangerous enemy yet.</p><p> <i>Reunion</i> is the eighth novel in the series and it is less a complete book than a continuation of the story. It's clear that Foster has bigger things in mind for Flinx and Pip. The novel is a page-turner, with lots of action to keep things moving. Fans of the series will find revelations in the book that make <i>Reunion</i> a must-read. However, those new to the series will wonder why they would want to read about a hero who seems, at best, morally questionable based on his first actions in <i>Reunion</i>. A bigger problem still is that the entire book seems to be just a teaser for the ninth novel, and if it takes another five years to arrive, that's a long tease. <i>--Kathie Huddleston</i></p>&#x201c;Bestseller Foster has created yet another entertaining adventure story in the far-flung reaches of a far-future outer space. . . . Using the traditional cliff-hangers and narrow escapes of classic SF adventure page-turners, and propelling Flinx from one crisis to another, from moral dilemma to deus-ex-machina, Foster enlists multiple formulas for a surefire . . . reading experience that should appeal to space-opera fans.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;Publishers Weekly<br></i><br>&#x201c;Flinx&#x2019;s trek through the deadly desert and his encounters with the AAnn make for a good read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Locus</i></p><h2>Home Free (Sisterhood)</h2><p>From the best-selling author of D�j� Vu comes a new book in the Sisterhood series.

Eventually, the town embraces the stranger as one of their own&#x2014;but do his bandages hide more than just scars?</p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Jeff Lemire</strong> <br><br> <strong>Question:</strong> <em>The Nobody</em> is loosely based on <em>The Invisible Man</em> by H.G. Wells. What about that classic novel piqued your creative impulse? <p></p> <p><strong>Jeff Lemire:</strong> I&#x2019;ve always been a big fan of H.G. Wells; in fact <em>The Time Machine</em> or <em>The Invisible Man</em> may well have been one of the very first science fiction novels I ever read as a child. But, specifically with <em>The Invisible Man</em>, I have always been fascinated with the idea of a bandaged stranger. On a purely visual level, it is just a cool character design, and on a deeper level he is the perfect cipher, like an empty vessel with which you can do anything. I think that&#x2019;s why there is such a long history of bandaged characters, particularly at DC, with <em>Unknown Soldier</em>, <em>The Doom Patrol</em>, and <em>Hush</em>. Also, anyone who knows my work, knows that I love to explore small towns and rural life, and the original novel has this amazing set up of this bizarre outsider showing up, and setting a tiny community abuzz. As soon as I started thinking about that, it seemed like a natural mix with my own ideas and interests.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> When referencing a classic work like <em>The Invisible Man</em>, how do you remain true to the spirit of the original while making something wholly new and contemporary?</p> <p><strong>Jeff Lemire:</strong> For me that was easy, because, as I&#x2019;ve said before, all of my past work has been set in small rural communities, so this was no different. It was basically me taking Wells&#x2019; set-up then twisting it into my own thing. And, while there are allusions and nods to the original text, it really does go off on its own path from the start. But, at its core it is an exploration of madness, loneliness and the dark side of rural life, which to me lines up perfectly with Wells&#x2019; vision.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> What do you think H.G. Wells would think of your graphic novel?</p> <p><strong>Jeff Lemire:</strong> That&#x2019;s a really tough question to answer, and one I had to stop thinking too much about while working on <em>The Nobody</em>, because the work of a master storyteller like H.G. Wells is something I could never hope to live up to. But, having said that, I would hope that he would recognize that the book was created with total respect of the source material, and as a testament to the iconic character he created so many years ago.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Your artwork in <em>The Nobody</em> speaks volumes with its sparse text and subtle panels. What artists and authors have influenced your work?</p> <p><strong>Jeff Lemire:</strong> I do tend to try and say as much with the artwork as possible, and when I do use text; I generally try to strip it down to the essentials. And, that tends to reflect the often sparse and cold settings of my work, and the loneliness of the characters that inhabit them. I think the main influences of this style of storytelling would be cinematic. Filmmakers like Wim Wenders, Ingmar Bergman, Tarkovsky and Kubrick. And, a very large influence on <em>The Nobody</em> was also David Lynch, particularly <em>Twin Peaks</em>, which I&#x2019;ve been a devoted fanatic of since it originally aired in the early 90s. All that weirdness going on under the surface of a Northwestern logging town obviously rubbed off on me and found its way into <em>The Nobody</em>.</p> <p>From a comics point of view the bold, expressive work of cartoonists like Jose Munoz, Igort, Paul Pope, Gipi and Dave McKean are big influences.</p>Jeff Lemire is the creator of the Vertigo graphic novel The Nobody and the acclaimed Essex County Trilogy (Tales from the Farm, Ghost Stories and Country Nurse) from Top Shelf Productions.

It also contains a section about winding your own pickups.</p><p>There are many different methods of designing and building an instrument. In this book, I am going to describe my personal approach and experiences. If work is carried out with great care and precision, everybody will in the end have a good-quality and nice-looking instrument to call their own. I would even go so far as to claim that a home-made electric guitar can well compete with expensive, industrially-manufactured makes; after all you can afford to select the best wood available and to buy highquality hardware as well as to tailor the instrument to fit your personal requirements. And, what's more, you can afford to invest a lot of time. I should also like to mention the special relationship with &#x201c;your&#x201d; guitar that you are going to enjoy, a feeling which you will hardly ever experience with a bought instrument."Kochuses the bare basics as a jumping off point, going on to describe electricguitarconstruction in a thorough and orderly manner" -- <i>Book review in issue number 63 of American Lutherie, the quartely journal of The Guild of American Luthiers</i></p><h2>Set in Stone: Butch on Butch Erotica</h2><p><p>In this brilliantly original anthology, 20 of the most celebrated erotica writers of recent years take us on a bumpy, naughty, no-holds-barred trip with the most elusive of lesbian creatures: butch women who know how to get one another's motors revving.

Evans, Nicole Foster, Catherine Lundoff, Lesl�a Newman, Thomas Roche, Anne Seale, and JenLynn Sweet.</p><p><b>Angela Brown</b> is a Los Angeles-based writer, editor, and cartoonist, whose interest in butch women was sparked early on by her marathon viewing of the Aussie television show <i>Prisoner: Cell Block H</i> as well as Pam Grier's numerous women-in-chains flicks.</p></p><p>While there's no lack of rude, inventive lesbian erotica at the moment, a few specialty interests have been overlooked in the better-known anthologies, among them the sweaty allure of butch-on-butch love. Editor Angela Brown blames the early, corrupting influence of the television show <i>Prisoner: Cell Block H</i> for her fascination with butch women, but she will make plenty of converts with this collection of wicked deeds, well-described. M. Christian's "The Bang Gang" begins with a trio of dyke terrorists firing a gun in a Ladies Room, and ends with two butches blushingly making a date. In "Bubbles and Buddy" by Lisa E. Davis (<i>Under The Mink</i>), a college student sent to interview a retired nightclub performer for a book on "older lesbians" winds up learning more than she expected. And, in "Who Casts the First Stone?" by Patrick Califia-Rice, an aging leather dyke chooses not to re-enact her own youthful humiliation at the hands of a stone butch, but to allow her new lover to touch her. With plenty of fetishistic attention to leather jackets, boxers, and boots, this book may even make a good fishnet stocking stuffer for kinky femmes. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Angela Brown is the editor in chief of Alyson Publications.

He states that the scam is so incredibly clever that you are probably actively supporting your own plunder. He explains how ignorance about the nature of money and the principles of economics allows swindlers to secretly tap into your wealth. He explains that the only source of wealth is individual effort and theft ultimately results in lower production and a lower standard of living, it destroys your incentive to work as well as the thief&#39;s since he need not produce things himself if he is successful in stealing from you. The theft he describes is legal theft where an individual uses the power of government to either control your right to exchange your property or to confiscate your property directly, by inflation, taxation, and regulation. His solution to stockpiling wealth that he calls the Alpha Strategy is simply a plan to begin investing in real goods instead of paper claims on wealth. He believes it is the only rational answer for the small saver and investor. Best-selling author John A. Pugsley is an economist, and investment adviser.</p><p></p><h2>Our Story Begins: New and Selected Stories</h2><p>&#x201c;One of our most exquisite storytellers&#x201d; <i>(Esquire)</i> gives us his first collection in over a decade: ten potent new stories that, along with twenty-one classics, display his mastery over a quarter century.<br><br>Tobias Wolff&#x2019;s first two books, <i>In the Garden of the North American Martyrs</i> and <i>Back in the World,</i> were a powerful demonstration of how the short story can &#x201c;provoke our amazed appreciation,&#x201d; as <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i> wrote then. In the years since, he&#x2019;s written a third collection, <i>The Night in Question,</i> as well as a pair of genre-defining memoirs <i>(This Boy&#x2019;s Life</i> and <i>In Pharaoh&#x2019;s Army),</i> the novella <i>The Barracks Thief,</i> and, most recently, a novel, <i>Old School.</i><br><br>Now he returns with fresh revelations&#x2014;about biding one&#x2019;s time, or experiencing first love, or burying one&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;that come to a variety of characters in circumstances at once everyday and extraordinary: a retired Marine enrolled in college while her son trains for Iraq, a lawyer taking a difficult deposition, an American in Rome indulging the Gypsy who&#x2019;s picked his pocket. In these stories, as with his earlier, much-anthologized work, he once again proves himself, according to the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> &#x201c;a writer of the highest order: part storyteller, part philosopher, someone deeply engaged in asking hard questions that take a lifetime to resolve.&#x201d;</p><p>Tobias Wolff is the author of seven previous books and the editor of <i>The Vintage Book of American Short Stories.</i> Among his honors are the PEN/Malamud Award and the Rea Award, both for excellence in the short story, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the PEN/Faulkner Award. He lives in Northern California and teaches at Stanford University.<b>Bullet in the Brain</b><br><br>Anders couldn't get to the bank until just before it closed, so of course the line was endless and he got stuck behind two women whose loud, stupid conversation put him in a murderous temper. He was never in the best of tempers anyway, Anders&#x2014;a book critic known for the weary, elegant savagery with which he dispatched almost everything he reviewed.<br><br>With the line still doubled around the rope, one of the tellers stuck a POSITION CLOSED sign in her window and walked to the back of the bank, where she leaned against a desk and began to pass the time with a man shuffling papers. The women in front of Anders broke off their conversation and watched the teller with hatred. "Oh, that's nice," one of them said. She turned to Anders and added, confident of his accord, "One of those little human touches that keep us coming back for more."<br><br>Anders had conceived his own towering hatred of the teller, but he immediately turned it on the presumptuous crybaby in front of him. "Damned unfair," he said. "Tragic, really. If they're not chopping off the wrong leg or bombing your ancestral village, they're closing their positions."<br><br>She stood her ground. "I didn't say it was tragic," she said. "I just think it's a pretty lousy way to treat your customers."<br><br>"Unforgivable," Anders said. "Heaven will take note."<br><br>She sucked in her cheeks but stared past him and said nothing. Anders saw that her friend was looking in the same direction. And then the tellers stopped what they were doing, the other customers slowly turned, and silence came over the bank. Two men wearing black ski masks and blue business suits were standing to the side of the door. One of them had a pistol pressed against the guard's neck. The guard's eyes were closed, and his lips were moving. The other man had a sawed-off shotgun. "Keep your big mouth shut!" the man with the pistol said, though no one had spoken a word. "One of you tellers hits the alarm, you're all dead meat."<br><br>"Oh, bravo," Anders said. "<i>'Dead meat.'</i>" He turned to the woman in front of him. "Great script, eh? The stern, brass-knuckled poetry of the dangerous classes."<br><br>She looked at him with drowning eyes.<br><br>The man with the shotgun pushed the guard to his knees. He handed the shotgun to his partner and yanked the guard's wrists up behind his back and locked them together with a pair of handcuffs. He toppled him onto the floor with a kick between the shoulder blades, then took his shotgun back and went over to the security gate at the end of the counter. He was short and heavy and moved with peculiar slowness. "Buzz him in," his partner said. The man with the shotgun opened the gate and sauntered along the line of tellers, handing each of them a plastic bag. When he came to the empty position he looked over at the man with the pistol, who said, "Whose slot is that?"<br><br>Anders watched the teller. She put her hand to her throat and turned to the man she'd been talked to. He nodded. "Mine," she said.<br><br>"Then get your ugly ass in gear and fill that bag."<br><br>"There you go," Anders said to the woman in front of him. "Justice is done."<br><br>"Hey! Bright boy! Did I tell you to talk?"<br><br>"No," Anders said.<br><br>"Then shut your trap."<br><br>"Did you hear that?" Anders said. "'Bright boy.'" Right of out <i>The Killers.</i>"<br><br>"Please, be quiet," the woman said.<br><br>"Hey, you deaf or what?" The man with the pistol walked over to Anders and poked the weapon into his gut. "You think I'm playing games?"<br><br>"No," Anders said, but the barrel tickled like a stiff finger and he had to fight back the titters. He did this by making himself stare into the man's eyes, which were clearly visible behind the holes in the mask: pale blue and rawly red rimmed. The man's left eyelid kept twitching. He breathed out a piercing, ammoniac smell that shocked Anders more than anything that had happened, and he was beginning to develop a sense of unease when the man prodded him again with the pistol.<br><br>"You like me, bright boy?" he said. "You want to suck my dick?"<br><br>"No," Anders said.<br><br>"Then stop looking at me."<br><br>Anders fixed his gaze on the man's shiny wing-tip shoes.<br><br>"Not down there. Up there." He stuck the pistol under Anders's chin and pushed it upward until he was looking at the ceiling.<br><br>Anders had never paid much attention to that part of the bank, a pompous old building with marble floors and counters and gilt scrollwork over the tellers' cages. The domed ceiling had been decorated with mythological figures whose fleshy, toga-draped ugliness Anders had taken in at a glance many years earlier and afterward declined to notice. Now he had no choice but to scrutinize the painter's work. It was even worse than he remembered, and all of it executed with the utmost gravity. The artist had a few tricks up his sleeve and used them again and again&#x2014;a certain rosy blush on the underside of the clouds, a coy backward glance on the faces of the cupids and fauns. The ceiling was crowded with various dramas, but the one that caught Anders's eye was Zeus and Europa&#x2014;portrayed, in this rendition, as a bull ogling a cow from behind a haystack. To make the cow sexy, the painter had canted her hips suggestively and given her long, droppy eyelashes through which she gazed back at the bull with sultry welcome. The bull wore a smirk and his eyebrows were arched. If there'd been a caption bubbling out of his mouth, it would have said HUBBA HUBBA.<br><br>"What's so funny, bright boy?"<br><br>"Nothing."<br><br>"You think I'm comical? You think I'm some kind of clown?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"You think you can fuck with me?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Fuck with me again, you're history. <i>Capiche?</i>"<br><br>Anders burst out laughing. He covered his mouth with both hands and said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," then snorted helplessly through his fingers and said, "<i>Capiche</i>&#x2014;oh, God, <i>capiche</i>," and at that the man with the pistol raised the pistol and shot Anders right through the head.<br>The bullet smashed Anders's skull and plowed through his brain and exited behind his right ear, scattering shards of bone into the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum, back toward the basal ganglia, and down into the thalamus. But before all this occurred, the first appearance of the bullet in the cerebrum set off a crackling chain of ion transports and neurotransmissions. Because of their peculiar origin these traced a peculiar pattern, flukishly calling to life a summer afternoon some forty years past, and lost since lost to memory. After striking the cranium the bullet was moving at nine hundred feet per second, a pathetically sluggish, glacial pace compared with the synaptic lightning that flashed around it. Once in the brain, that is, the bullet came under the mediation of brain time, which gave Anders plenty of time to contemplate the scene that, in a phrase he would have abhorred, "passed before his eyes."<br><br>It is worth noting what Anders did not remember, given what he did recall. He did not remember his first lover, Sherry, or what he had most madly loved about her, before it came to irritate him&#x2014;her unembarrassed carnality, and especially the cordial way she had with his unit, which she called Mr. Mole, as in <i>Uh-oh, looks like Mr. Mole wants to play</i>. Anders did not remember his wife, whom he had also loved before she exhausted him with her predictability, or his daughter, now a sullen professor of economics at Dartmouth. He did not remember standing just outside his daughter's door as she lectured her bear about his naughtiness and described the appalling punishments Paws would receive unless he changed his ways. He did not remember a single line of the hundreds of poems he had committed to memory in his youth so he could give himself the shivers at will&#x2014;not "Silent, upon a peak in Darien," or "My God, I heard this day," or "All my pretty ones? Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?" None of these did he remember; not one. Anders did not remember his dying mother saying of his father, "I should have stabbed him in his sleep."<br><br>He did not remember Professor Josephs telling his class how Athenian prisoners in Sicily had been released if they could recite Aeschylus, and then reciting Aeschylus himself, right there, in the Greek. Anders did not remember how his eyes had burned at those sounds. He did not remember the surprise of seeing a college classmate's name on the dust jacket of a novel not long after they graduted, or the respect he had felt after reading the book. He did not remember the pleasure of giving respect.<br><br>Nor did Anders remember seeing a woman leap to her death from the building opposite his own just days after his daughter was born. He did not remember shouting, "Lord have mercy!" He did not remember deliberately crashing his father's car into a tree, or having his ribs kicked in by three policemen at an antiwar rally, or waking himself up with laughter. He did not remember when he began to regard the heap of books on his desk with boredom and dread, or when he grew angry at writers for writing them. He did not remember when everything began to remind him of something else.<br><br>This is what he remembered. Heat. A baseball field. Yellow grass, the whir of insects, himself leaning against a tree as the boys of the neighborhood gather for a pickup game. He looks on as the others argue the relative genius of Mantle and Mays. They have been worrying this subject all summer, and it has become tedious to Anders: an oppression, like the heat.<br><br>Then the last two boys arrive, Coyle an...</p><h2>Prague Counterpoint (The Zion Covenant, 2)</h2><p>Opening in 1936, the Zion Covenant series tells the courageous and compelling stories of those who risk everything to stand against the growing tide of Nazi terrorism that is sweeping through central Europe under the dangerous and deceitful guise of Hitler&#39;s Third Reich.

And as the tanager woos a mate and begins to build a nest, Dvor�k writes the bird&#x2019;s music down on everything from paper to shirtsleeves. At the end of one long summer evening, the scarlet tanager hears familiar music from the town&#x2019;s schoolhouse and settles on a branch nearby to listen. Inside, Dvor�k and his friends play the first rehearsal of &#x201c;American Quartet,&#x201d; inspired by the little songbird. Then, while one plays on, the other flies home.<br></p><p>Carole Lexa Schaefer is the author of many children&#x2019;s books, including <i>The Squiggle</i> and <i>Snow Pumpkin</i>. <br><br>Elizabeth Rosen has won many awards for her artwork. This is her first book for children.<br>Grade 1-4-In the author's terms, "historical fact and imagination are woven together" to describe how the famous Czech composer heard the song of the scarlet tanager while summering in Iowa in 1893 and was inspired to write the third movement of the American Quartet, a string quartet in F major. The story eloquently captures the essence of listening and skillfully demonstrates the patience and dedication Dvor k shows in trying to hear the bird's song and to re-create the melody with musical instruments. As the composer works, the bird is equally busy, finding a mate and building a nest. Gorgeously colored illustrations complement the subject matter. The red bird is always visible, even amid bright blues, greens, and yellows. The artist uses thickly applied oils in vibrant swirls to create van Goghesque paintings that seem to have rhythm and movement of their own. An author's note provides historical background.

The world has utterly, irreversibly, and radically evolved since she ascended the throne in 1952 and yet, in an era of instant celebrity, she remains, more popular than ever and seemingly largely unchanged: a bastion of certainty and comfort to the British and many other people during uncertain times.�&nbsp;</p><p>On 9th September 2015, she will beat Queen Victoria's record and become the longest-reigning monarch in British history. The question is: How secure is the British Royal Family? How much depends on the person of the Queen herself, and how much on the institution?</p><p>To answer these questions,<i> Royalty Inc.</i> will combine a history of the British Crown's evolution thorugh the modern age with a journalistic peek behind the curtain at the machinery that sustains the Windsors today. Written by the <i>Guardian</i>'s former Royal correspondent, its line will be neither royalist nor republican. Instead it will take a clear-eyed look at a host of issues, including the future of the Commonwealth, the Monarchy's role in the British constitution and class system, Prince Charles' notorious 'black spider memos', the true scale of the Royal finances, the legacy of Diana, and the problems and pressures faced by any heir to the throne in the future.�&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>STEPHEN BATES</b>�&nbsp;was educated at New College, Oxford, where he took a degree in Modern History.

He turned his eye to the world, to the cultures and the people around him, and saw reflections of himself. In this collection, he works in both free verse and traditional forms, rendering scenes of exquisite detail that pry into the hearts of his characters and reveal the contradictions that bind father to son, lover to lover, and person to person. From the broken hills and drowsy river valleys around Paducah, Kentucky, to Houston diners and Gulf Coast shrimp boats, to the tropical cityscape of Miami, Bolton creates vivid scenes in which his characters confront the loneliness and the "little music" of their lives. With a richly musical voice and an ear for the cadences of everyday speech, Bolton gives his readers not the trappings of love and grief, but the very things themselves, rendered in lines that reverberate with the authority of sincerity and truth.</p><p>Joe Bolton taught at both the University of Arizona and the University of Florida at Gainesville.Adult Situations<br> After Rain<br> Alcohol<br> American Tragedy<br> American Variations: 1.

Impossible but true, because Henry suffers from a rare condition where his genetic clock periodically resets and he finds himself pulled suddenly into his past or future. In the face of this force they can neither prevent nor control, Henry and Clare&#39;s struggle to lead normal lives is both intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.</p><p>Audrey Niffenegger is an exceptionally creative writer and visual artist who has achieved enormous success in both worlds. Her debut novel, The Time Traveler's Wife, has sold nearly five million copies worldwide and has been translated into thirty-three languages to date.

I sign the Visitors' Log: Clare Abshire, 11:15 10-26-91 Special Collections. I have never been in the Newberry Library before, and now that I've gotten past the dark, foreboding entrance I am excited. I have a sort of Christmas-morning sense of the library as a big box full of beautiful books. The elevator is dimly lit, almost silent. I stop on the third floor and fill out an application for a Reader's Card, then I go upstairs to Special Collections. My boot heels rap the wooden floor. The room is quiet and crowded, full of solid, heavy tables piled with books and surrounded by readers. Chicago autumn morning light shines through the tall windows. I approach the desk and collect a stack of call slips. I'm writing a paper for an art history class. My research topic is the Kelmscott Press Chaucer. I look up the book itself and fill out a call slip for it. But I also want to read about papermaking at Kelmscott. The catalog is confusing. I go back to the desk to ask for help. As I explain to the woman what I am trying to find, she glances over my shoulder at someone passing behind me. "Perhaps Mr. DeTamble can help you," she says. I turn, prepared to start explaining again, and find myself face to face with Henry.<br><br>I am speechless. Here is Henry, calm, clothed, younger than I have ever seen him. Henry is working at the Newberry Library, standing in front of me, in the present. Here and now. I am jubilant. Henry is looking at me patiently, uncertain but polite.<br><br>"Is there something I can help you with?" he asks.<br><br>"Henry!" I can barely refrain from throwing my arms around him. It is obvious that he has never seen me before in his life.<br><br>"Have we met? I'm sorry, I don't...." Henry is glancing around us, worrying that readers, co-workers are noticing us, searching his memory and realizing that some future self of his has met this radiantly happy girl standing in front of him. The last time I saw him he was sucking my toes in the Meadow.<br><br>I try to explain. "I'm Clare Abshire. I knew you when I was a little girl..." I'm at a loss because I am in love with a man who is standing before me with no memories of me at all. Everything is in the future for him. I want to laugh at the weirdness of the whole thing. I'm flooded with years of knowledge of Henry, while he's looking at me perplexed and fearful. Henry wearing my dad's old fishing trousers, patiently quizzing me on multiplication tables, French verbs, all the state capitals; Henry laughing at some peculiar lunch my seven-year-old self has brought to the Meadow; Henry wearing a tuxedo, undoing the studs of his shirt with shaking hands on my eighteenth birthday. Here! Now! "Come and have coffee with me, or dinner or something...." Surely he has to say yes, this Henry who loves me in the past and the future must love me now in some bat-squeak echo of other time. To my immense relief he does say yes. We plan to meet tonight at a nearby Thai restaurant, all the while under the amazed gaze of the woman behind the desk, and I leave, forgetting about Kelmscott and Chaucer and floating down the marble stairs, through the lobby and out into the October Chicago sun, running across the park scattering small dogs and squirrels, whooping and rejoicing.<br><br>HENRY: It's a routine day in October, sunny and crisp. I'm at work in a small windowless humidity-controlled room on the fourth floor of the Newberry, cataloging a collection of marbled papers that has recently been donated. The papers are beautiful, but cataloging is dull, and I am feeling bored and sorry for myself. In fact, I am feeling old, in the way only a twenty-eight-year-old can after staying up half the night drinking overpriced vodka and trying, without success, to win himself back into the good graces of Ingrid Carmichel. We spent the entire evening fighting, and now I can't even remember what we were fighting about. My head is throbbing. I need coffee. Leaving the marbled papers in a state of controlled chaos, I walk through the office and past the page's desk in the Reading Room. I am halted by Isabelle's voice saying, "Perhaps Mr. DeTamble can help you," by which she means "Henry, you weasel, where are you slinking off to?" And this astoundingly beautiful amber-haired tall slim girl turns around and looks at me as though I am her personal Jesus. My stomach lurches. Obviously she knows me, and I don't know her. Lord only knows what I have said, done, or promised to this luminous creature, so I am forced to say in my best librarianese, "Is there something I can help you with?" The girl sort of breathes "Henry!" in this very evocative way that convinces me that at some point in time we have a really amazing thing together. This makes it worse that I don't know anything about her, not even her name. I say "Have we met?" and Isabelle gives me a look that says You asshole. But the girl says, "I'm Clare Abshire. I knew you when I was a little girl," and invites me out to dinner. I accept, stunned. She is glowing at me, although I am unshaven and hung over and just not at my best. We are going to meet for dinner this very evening, at the Beau Thai, and Clare, having secured me for later, wafts out of the Reading Room. As I stand in the elevator, dazed, I realize that a massive winning lottery ticket chunk of my future has somehow found me here in the present, and I start to laugh. I cross the lobby, and as I run down the stairs to the street I see Clare running across Washington Square, jumping and whooping, and I am near tears and I don't know why.<br><br>Later that evening:<br><br>HENRY: At 6:00 p.m. I race home from work and attempt to make myself attractive. Home these days is a tiny but insanely expensive studio apartment on North Dearborn; I am constantly banging parts of myself on inconvenient walls, countertops and furniture. Step One: unlock seventeen locks on apartment door, fling myself into the living room-which-is-also-my-bedroom and begin stripping off clothing. Step Two: shower and shave. Step Three: stare hopelessly into the depths of my closet, gradually becoming aware that nothing is exactly clean. I discover one white shirt still in its dry cleaning bag. I decide to wear the black suit, wing tips, and pale blue tie. Step Four: don all of this and realize I look like an FBI agent. Step Five: look around and realize that the apartment is a mess. I resolve to avoid bringing Clare to my apartment tonight even if such a thing is possible. Step Six: look in full-length bathroom mirror and behold angular, wild-eyed 6' 1" ten-year-old Egon Schiele look-alike in clean shirt and funeral director suit. I wonder what sorts of outfits this woman has seen me wearing, since I am obviously not arriving from my future into her past wearing clothes of my own. She said she was a little girl? A plethora of unanswerables runs through my head. I stop and breathe for a minute. Okay. I grab my wallet and my keys, and away I go: lock the thirty-seven locks, descend in the cranky little elevator, buy roses for Clare in the shop in the lobby, walk two blocks to the restaurant in record time but still five minutes late. Clare is already seated in a booth and she looks relieved when she sees me. She waves at me like she's in a parade.<br><br>"Hello," I say. Clare is wearing a wine-colored velvet dress and pearls. She looks like a Botticelli by way of John Graham: huge gray eyes, long nose, tiny delicate mouth like a geisha. She has long red hair that covers her shoulders and falls to the middle of her back. Clare is so pale she looks like a waxwork in the candlelight. I thrust the roses at her. "For you."<br><br>"Thank you," says Clare, absurdly pleased. She looks at me and realizes that I am confused by her response. "You've never given me flowers before."<br><br>I slide into the booth opposite her. I'm fascinated. This woman knows me; this isn't some passing acquaintance of my future hegiras. The waitress appears and hands us menus.<br><br>"Tell me," I demand.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Everything. I mean, do you understand why I don't know you? I'm terribly sorry about that-"<br><br>"Oh, no, you shouldn't be. I mean, I know...why that is." Clare lowers her voice. "It's because for you none of it has happened yet, but for me, well, I've known you for a long time."<br>Copyright � 2003 by Audrey Niffenegger<br><br>All rights reserved.

Greene Series)</h2><p><p>Pinned down by a posse, the wounded outlaw&#x2019;s companions urged him to escape through the gulch. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wait for me,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all in and might as well end it right here.&#x201d; Placing his revolver to his right temple, he pulled the trigger for the last time, thus ending the life of the notorious &#x201c;Kid Curry&#x201d; of the Wild Bunch.</p><p>It is long past time for the publication of a well-researched, definitive biography of the infamous western outlaw Harvey Alexander Logan, better known by his alias Kid Curry. He spent his formative years near Kansas City, Missouri, and came west with his older brother to become a cowboy. A violent conflict with a ranching neighbor in Montana caused him to flee to the Hole-in-the-Wall valley in Wyoming, where he became involved in rustling and eventually graduated to bank and train robbing as a member&#x2014;and soon leader&#x2014;of the Wild Bunch. This outlaw group was a melding of the best of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang and Butch Cassidy&#x2019;s Powder Springs gang, from the area where the borders of Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming meet. The core members of the gang came to be Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, George &#x201c;Flatnose&#x201d; Currie, Elzy Lay, Ben &#x201c;the Tall Texan&#x201d; Kilpatrick, Will Carver, and Kid Curry.</p><p>Kid Curry has been portrayed as a cold-blooded killer, without any compassion or conscience and possessed of limited intelligence. Curry indeed was a dangerous man with a violent temperament, which was aggravated by alcoholic drink. When he felt taken advantage of or was threatened with losing his freedom, he didn&#x2019;t hesitate to use force to defend himself by ambushing a posse or shooting at policemen. However, Mark T. Smokov shows that Curry&#x2019;s record of kills is highly exaggerated, and that he was not the bloodthirsty killer that many have claimed. In fact, when he was brought to trial, he was charged (and convicted) with forging and passing stolen banknotes, instead of murder or even train robbery, due to lack of evidence for the many murders attributed to him.</p><p>Smokov has researched extensively in areas significant to Curry&#x2019;s story (Hole-in-the-Wall, Brown&#x2019;s Park, the Little Rockies), talking to local ranchers and townspeople, visiting museums, and collecting pertinent material and photographs. He corrects the many false statements that have been written about Curry in the past, presenting a much more accurate and balanced account of his life. Curry was a cunning outlaw who planned and executed robberies on par with anything Butch Cassidy is reported to have pulled off. Smokov contends that Curry was the actual train robbing leader of the Wild Bunch&#x2014;there is no concrete evidence that Cassidy ever robbed a train. He also presents new evidence that is virtually conclusive in resolving whether or not Curry was the &#x201c;unknown bandit&#x201d; who killed himself after robbing a train near Parachute, Colorado, in 1904.</p></p><p><p>MARK T. SMOKOV is the author of several articles on Kid Curry and other western outlaws. He has written for the WWHA <i>Journal</i>, the NOLA <i>Quarterly</i>, the WOLA <i>Journal</i>, <i>Wild West</i> magazine, and the <i>Tombstone Epitaph</i>. He is a life-long resident of Seattle, Washington, and a graduate of the University of Washington.</p><p>&#x201c;Mark Smokov&#x2019;s new book on Harvey Logan is a significant contribution to Wild Bunch history. It is full of both primary and secondary sources which Smokov has used to fill out the life of one of the Old West&#x2019;s deadliest outlaws. I highly recommend it to those who are interested in both a good read and good research.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Donna B. Ernst</b>, author of <i>The Sundance Kid: The Life of Harry Alonzo Longabaugh</i> </p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Smokov&#x2019;s biography is well organized and displays an admirable command of the literature. He has traveled to many of the locations of key events in the Logan story for a first-hand look. His treatment of the controversy over whether Logan died after an unsuccessful train holdup in Colorado in 1904 is excellent&#x2014;I agree with his conclusion.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Daniel Buck</b>, Wild Bunch historian</p><br><br><p>"[A] rock-solid recreation of Old West grit and gunsmoke. . . . Smokov--noting that Logan was not dull-witted, as usually depicted--examines and dissects numerous conflicting sources throughout this well-researched biography. . . . Exploring archives and court records, Smokov shows how writers have embellished the Kid Curry legend, and he successfully separates raw reality from myth and speculation in this definitive profile of a cunning criminal."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Harvey &#x2018;Kid Curry&#x2019; Logan continues to fascinate historians, partly because of ongoing attempts to unravel fact from fiction about his life, and partly because of the need to do the same about his death. This is the most valiant attempt to date to piece together a coherent account of the outlaw&#x2019;s life. Mark Smokov doesn&#x2019;t duck the difficult questions of conflicting evidence regarding Logan&#x2019;s activities, nor does he rush to judgment and lay every alleged crime to have been committed by Logan at his door. He is fair and balanced in his analysis of previous research, giving full credit where it is due while pointing out the myths and legends that still pepper popular accounts of Logan&#x2019;s life and death.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Mike Bell</b>, author of <i>Incidents on Owl Creek</i></p><br><br>"In his book, Smokov traces Logan's career from cowpuncher to major outlaw, offering answers to many, but not all, of the questions that have arisen since Logan's alleged death in 1904."--<i>True West</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;The author presents a thoroughly researched and documented argument that Kid Curry was a cunning and capable leader of the Wild Bunch outlaws.

All disappears<br>as time and the darkness steal color and rhyme.<br>&#x2013; Dominic to Solange</p><p></p><p>Carpathian males without a lifemate didn't dream. They didn't see in color and they certainly didn't feel emotion. Pain, yes, but not emotion. So why had he been reaching for a dream for the past few years? He was an ancient, an experienced warrior. He had no time for fantasy, or for imagination. His world was stark and barren, a necessity for battling an enemy who, inevitably, had been a friend or family member.</p><p>Over the first hundred or so years after losing his emotions, he had held out hope. As centuries passed, the hope of finding his lifemate had faded. He had accepted he would find her in the next life and he was carrying out his resolve to do his last duty to his people. Yet here he was, an ancient of great experience, Dominic of the Dragonseeker line, a lineage as old as time itself, a man of wisdom, a warrior renowned and feared&#x2014;lying awake beneath the rich soil, dreaming.</p><p>Dreams should have felt insubstantial&#x2014;and at first his had been. A woman. Just a vague idea of her appearance. So young in comparison to him, but a warrior in her own right. She hadn't been his concept of the woman who would partner him, yet as she grew in substance over the years, he realized how perfect she was for him. He had fought far too long to ever lay down his sword. He knew no other way of life. Duty and sacrifice were bred into his very bones and he needed a woman who could understand him.</p><p>Perhaps that was what dreams were. He'd never dreamt until a few years ago. Never. Dreams were emotions, and he'd long ago lost those. Dreams were color, although not his. But they felt like color as the years shaped the woman. She was a mystery, sheer confidence when she fought. She often had fresh bruises and wounds that left scars on her soft skin. He'd taken to examining her carefully each time they met&#x2014;healing her had become a traditional greeting. He found himself smiling inside, thinking how she was entirely the opposite of confident when it came to viewing herself as a woman.</p><p>For a few moments he contemplated why he should be smiling inside. Smiling was equated with happiness, and he had no emotions to feel such things, but his memories of emotions were sharpening as he moved toward the end of his life, instead of dimming as he had expected. Because when he summoned the dream, he felt a sense of comfort, of well-being and happiness.</p><p>Over the years she had become clearer to him. A jaguar-woman. A fierce warrior with exactly the same values he held on loyalty and family and duty. He would never forget the night, only a week ago, when he saw her eyes in color. For a moment he couldn't breathe, looking at her in wonder, shocked that he could remember colors so vividly that he could attribute an actual color to her cat's eyes.</p><p>Her eyes were beautiful, glowing green with faint hints of gold and amber that darkened when he managed to elicit a laugh from her. She didn't laugh often or easily, and when she did, he felt it was more of a victory than any of the battles he'd won.</p><p>As dreams went&#x2014;and they only occurred when he was awake&#x2014;they always seemed a bit out of focus. But he looked forward to seeing her. He felt protective toward her, as if his allegiance had already swung toward his dream woman. He wrote to her, songs of love, saying all the things he wished to tell his lifemate. And when she refused to rest, he'd lay her down, her head in his lap, stroking her thick mane of hair and singing to her in his language. He'd never felt more content&#x2014;or more complete.</p><p>He stirred, disturbing the rich soil surrounding him. The moment he moved, the pain took him, thousands of knives ripping from the inside out. The tainted vampire blood he'd deliberately swallowed had been thick with parasites, and they moved in him, replicating, seeking to take over his body, to invade every cell, every organ. And as often as he purged some to keep the numbers down, they seemed to work harder to multiply.</p><p>Dominic hissed out his breath between his teeth as he forced his rising. It was not yet fully night and he was an ancient Carpathian with many battles and kills to his name. As a rule ancients didn't rise before the sun had set, but he needed the extra time to scout his enemy and get his bearings in this land of walking myths and legends.</p><p>Deep within the cave he'd chosen in the Amazon forest, he moved the earth gently, allowing it to settle around him as he awakened, wanting to keep the area as undisturbed as possible. He traveled only at night, as his kind did, listening to the whisper of evil, on the trail of a master vampire, one he was certain had knowledge of the plans to destroy the Carpathian species once and for all. His people knew that the vampires were coming together under the rule of the five. At first the groups had been small and scattered, the attacks easily fended off , but lately the whisper of conspiracy had grown into a roar, and the groups were larger and more organized and widespread than first thought. He was certain the parasites in the tainted blood were the key to identifying all those forging an allegiance to the five <i>masters</i>.</p><p>He'd gleaned that much over his days of traveling. He had tested the theory several times, coming across three vampires. Two were relatively new, and neither had the parasites and were easy for an experienced hunter to kill. But the third had satisfied his questions. The moment he came into close proximity, the parasites had gone into a frenzy of recognition. He had listened to the vampire bragging for most of the night, telling him of their growing legions and how emissaries were meeting in the Amazon, where they had allies in the jaguar-men and a human society that had no idea they were in bed with the very ones they sought to destroy. The <i>masters</i> were using both humans and jaguar-men to hunt and kill Carpathians. Dominic had killed the vampire, a quick extraction of the heart, and, calling down the lightning, incinerated him. Before leaving the area, he had taken great care to remove any trace of his presence.</p><p>He knew time was running out fast. The parasites were hard at work, whispering to him, murmuring evil enticements, unrelenting in their quest for him to join with the <i>masters</i>. He was an ancient without a lifemate and the darkness was strong in him already. His beloved sister had disappeared hundreds of years earlier&#x2014;he now knew she was dead and her children safe with the Carpathian people. He could do this one last task and end his barren existence with honor.</p><p>He rose from the rich soil, as rejuvenated as one with parasites in his blood could possibly be. The cave deep beneath the earth kept the sun from touching his skin, but he felt it anyway, knowing it was just outside the darkness, waiting to scorch him. His skin prickled and burned in anticipation. He strode through the cave with absolute confidence. He moved with the easy self-assurance of a warrior, flowing over the uneven ground in the darkness.</p><p>As he began the climb to the surface, he thought of her&#x2014;his lifemate, the woman in his dreams. She wasn't his true lifemate of course, because if she were he would be seeing colors vividly, not just her eyes. He would see the various shades of green in the rain forest, but everything around him remained gray hued. Was finding solace with her cheating? Was singing to her about his love of his lifemate cheating? He longed for her, needing to conjure her up at times to get through the night when his blood was on fire and he was being eaten alive from the inside out. He thought of her soft skin, a sensation that seemed amazing when he was like an oak tree, hard iron, his skin as tough as leather.</p><p>As he neared the exit of the cave, he could see light spilling into the tunnel and his body cringed, an automatic reaction after centuries of living in the night. He loved the night, no matter where he was or what continent he was on. The moon was a friend, the stars often guiding lights he navigated by. He was in unfamiliar territory, but he knew the De La Cruz brothers patrolled the rain forest, although there were five of them to cover a very large territory and they were spread thin. He had a feeling the five who were recruiting the lesser vampires against the Carpathians had deliberately chosen the De La Cruz territory as their headquarters.</p><p>The Malinov brothers and the De La Cruz brothers had grown up together, more than friends, claiming a kinship. They'd been regarded by the Carpathian people as two of the most powerful families, warriors unsurpassed by many. Dominic thought about their personalities, and the camaraderie that had turned into a rivalry. It made sense that the Malinov brothers would choose to set their headquarters right under the noses of the very ones who had plotted theoretical ways to remove the Dubrinsky line as rulers of the Carpathian people and then, in the end, had sworn their allegiance to the prince. The Malinov brothers would become the De La Cruz brothers' most bitter and unrelenting enemies.</p><p>Dominic's logical line of reasoning had been confirmed by the vampire he had killed in the Carpathian Mountains, a very talkative lesser vampire who wanted to brag about all he knew. Dominic had made his way, taking no prisoners, so to speak, surprised at how the parasites were such a fantastic warning system. It had never occurred to the Malinov brothers that any Carpathian would dare to ingest the blood and invade their very camp.</p><p>Going closer to the cave entrance, he was hit by the noise first, the sounds of birds and monkeys and the incessant hum of insects in spite of the steady rain. It was hot, and steam actually rose from the floor just outside the cave as the moisture poured down from the skies. Trees hung over the swollen banks of the river, their root systems great gnarled cages, the thick tendrils snaking over the ground to create waves of wooden fins.</p><p>Dominic was impervious to rain or heat; he could regulate his own temperature to stay comfortable. But those thirty feet or so from the entrance of his cave to the relative safety under the thick canopy were going to be hell, and he wasn't looking forward to it. Traveling in the sun, even in another form, was painful, and with the sensation of glass shards ripping his insides to shreds, he had enough to contend with.</p><p>It was difficult not to reach for the dream. In her company, the pain eased and the whispering in his head ceased. The constant murmurs, the parasites working on his acceptance of the <i>masters</i> and their plan, were wearying. The dream gave him solace in spite of knowing his lifemate wasn't real.</p><p>He knew he had slowly built up his lifemate in his mind&#x2014;not her looks, but her characteristics, the traits that were important to him. He needed a woman who was loyal beyond all else, a woman who would guard their children fiercely, who would stand with him no matter what came at them, one he would know was at his side, and he wouldn't have to worry that she couldn't protect herself or their children.</p><p>He needed a woman who, when it was just the two of them, would follow his lead, who would be feminine and fragile and all the things she couldn't be during the times they would have to fight. And he wanted that side of her completely to himself. It was selfish, maybe, but he had never had anything for himself, and his woman was for him alone. He didn't want other men to see her the way he did. He didn't want her to look at other men. She was for him alone, and maybe that was what a dream really was&#x2014;building the perfect woman in your mind when you knew you'd never have one.</p><p>He was well aware of her fighting skills. He saw the battle scars. He respected and admired her when he walked with her, yet he couldn't really hold her image for long. In dreams she came to him, shielded by a heavy veil, their exchanges in images more than words. It had taken a long time for either to reveal any part of themselves other than the warrior. They'd built trust between them slowly&#x2014;and he liked that about her. She didn't give her allegiance easily, but when she did, she gave it wholly. And it was to him.</p><p>Again he found himself smiling inside at such a ridiculous fantasy at his age. It must be a sign of his mind deteriorating. Senility had set in. But how he missed her when he couldn't bring her to him. She seemed closer there in the heat of the forest, with the rain coming down in silvery sheets. The veil of moisture reminded him of the first time he'd managed to peer through that haze in his dream and see her face so clearly. She'd stolen his breath. She'd looked so frightened, as if she'd deliberately revealed herself&#x2014;finally taken a chance, but stood trembling, waiting for him to pass judgment on her.</p><p>At that moment he'd felt closer to actual love than he ever had before. He tried to compare the feeling with what he'd felt for his sister, Rhiannon, in the early days when they'd all been happy and he still had his emotions. He'd held on to the memory of love all those centuries, yet now, when he needed the feeling to complete his dream, before he went out fighting, the feeling was entirely different.</p><p><i>Feeling</i>. He turned the word over and over in his mind. What did it mean? Memories? Or reality? And why would his memories be so sharp all of a sudden, here in the forest? He smelled the rain, inhaled the scent of it, and there was an edge of pleasure in the sensation. It was frustrating, to almost catch the feeling, and yet it eluded him. It wasn't simply a byproduct of ingesting the vampire blood&#x2014;he'd begun "dreaming" much earlier. And the dreams took place while he was awake.</p><p>He was suspicious of all things that didn't make sense. He wasn't a man prone to dreams or fantasies, and this mythical woman was becoming too much a part of his life&#x2014;of him. She was tricking him into thinking she was a true lifemate&#x2014;a reality instead of a myth&#x2014;yet here in the land where myths and legends came to life, he could almost convince himself she was real. But even if she was, it was far too late. The continual pain clawing at his belly told him his time had run its course and he had to carry out his plan to infiltrate the enemy camp, gain their plans, send the information to Zacarias De La Cruz and then kill as many vampires as he could before he went down. He chose to go out fighting for his people.</p><p>He shifted, taking the form of the lord of the skies&#x2014;the harpy eagle. The bird was larger than normal, and the harpies were already large birds. His wingspan was a good seven feet, his talons enormous. The form would help to protect him as he went into the sunlight before reaching the relative shelter of the canopy. He hopped on the ground and into the light. In spite of the heavy rain, the light burst over him. Smoke rose from the dark feathers, pouring off the bird's form. He'd suffered burns and his body remained ravaged with the scars, although they'd eased over time, but he would never forget that pain. It was branded into his very bones.</p><p>Sharply sucking in his breath, he forced himself to spread his wings and rise toward that hideous...</p></p><h2>Christgau&#39;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#39;90s</h2><p><b>The Dean of American Rock Critics tackles the decade when music exploded.</b><br><br>The '90s saw more albums produced and distributed than any other decade.

It is also an intimate, revealing portrait of the royal family - King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret - hard at work in the national interest, and succeeding triumphantly against all odds.</b><br><br>The year 1947 was a pivotal moment not just in the history of the Union of South Africa, but of the British Empire itself. Later that same year India gained independence and just one year later the Afrikaner Nationalist victory in South Africa would lead inexorably to the Republic of South Africa in 1961 and its departure from the Commonwealth. <br><br>Graham Viney's book not only superbly captures a moment in the life of a fractious, recently formed 'nation', before its descent into over three decades of darkness, but also gives us an intimate and revealing portrait of the royal family. The present Queen Elizabeth must have learned a great deal about statecraft from her father, and about duty, tact and hard work from both her parents in the course of this three-month tour, during which the then princess celebrated her twenty-first birthday. It was also the family's first real experience of multiculturalism. <br><br>The royal family travelled ceaselessly, from February to April, on a specially commissioned, white-and-gold train, meeting thousands of people at every stop along the way. The tour was a show of imperial solidarity and a recognition of South Africa's contribution to the Allied cause during the Second World War, specifically that of South African prime minister Jan Smuts, who had served in both British war cabinets.<br><br><i>The Last Hurrah </i>draws skilfully on many diverse sources, including the Royal Archive at Windsor, and includes many photographs of the royal family not previously published, including stills from film footage unearthed in the South African Railway Museum archives.</p><p>GRAHAM VINEY was educated at the Diocesan College (Bishops), Cape Town, and Oxford University where he read International Relations.

This book brings to life both the bonds of empire and its end, and has the breath of the past in the detail: the way people dressed to depart on the white train; the Queen's disarming reply to an old fighter unwilling to forgive England for the Boer War; the family appeal overcoming Afrikaner suspicions of snootiness; and the smells of the time: acrid railway engine smoke, stoep polish and teatime silver in the sun. This is a layered book, written with insight into the disparate views of Blacks, Indians, Coloureds, the party led by Smuts and the proponents of apartheid lurking in the wings. This is an appealing story of a might-have-been, the apparent success of the Royals in bringing a divided country together but, in the end, a success that could not change votes, dominated by racial issues. <i>The Last Hurrah</i> is a superb achievement, graceful, readable, deeply researched and enhanced by rare photographs.&#x2015;<b>Lyndall Gordon, author of The Imperfect Life of T.

In Viney's hands, this . . . turns into an unforgettable excursion into a world peopled by gracious blue bloods, lovely princesses, bowing colonials and great throngs of Boers and Africans, inexplicably cheering the rulers of a kingdom that had subjugated their ancestors. Bathed in the fading glow of empire and buffeted by the coming storm of political struggle, Viney's South Africa is a country most of us will barely recognise, teetering on the brink of tumultuous change and yet almost united, at least for a moment, by love for a king and queen who weren't really ours.

Fitzgerald</h2><p>Jay Gatsby is a self-made man, famed for his decadent champagne-drenched parties. Despite being surrounded by Long Island&#39;s bright and beautiful, he longs only for Daisy Buchanan. In shimmering prose, Fitzgerald shows Gatsby pursue his dream to its tragic conclusion.</p><p>In 1922, F Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple, intricately patterned". That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned and, above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace be comes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties and waits for her to appear. When s he does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbour Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem. <i>Perry Freeman, Amazon.com</i></p>"<i>The Great Gatsby</i> remains not just one of the greatest works of American literature, but a timeless evocation of the allure, corruption and carelessness of wealth...a gilded society intoxicated by wealth, dancing its way into the Great Depression." (<i>The Times</i>)<br><br>"<i>Gatsby</i> is a connoisseur's guide to the glamour and glitter of the Jazz Age, but it's also a nearly prophetic glimpse into the world to come. Writing at the height of the boom, in the midst of the Roaring Twenties, Fitzgerald detected the ephemerality, fakery and corruption always lurking at the heart of the great American success story... A haunting meditation on aspiration, disillusionment, romantic love - and a blistering expos� of the materialism, duplicity, and sexual politics driving what Fitzgerald calls America's true "business": "the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty"" (Sarah Churchwell, <i>The Times</i>)<br><br>"It is a marvellously suggestive novel...a parable of modern America, and by extension of modern life" (AN Wilson, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"The first and greatest modern novel, it has beautiful women, lavish parties, romance, betrayal and murder woven together in an intricately structured plot. A prescient comment on the dying days of a gilded age that is brilliant entertainment with a very eloquent insight" (<i>Mirror</i>)<br><br>"His masterpiece, an elegy for the American Dream, the greatest lost cause of them all" (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)</p><h2>Monster&#39;s Lunch Box</h2><p>An interactive picture book that details the gruesome contents of a monster&#39;s lunchbox.</p><p>Marc Brown is the creator of the bestselling Arthur Adventure book series and creative producer of the number-one children&#39;s PBS television series, Arthur. He has also illustrated many other books for children, including Ten Tiny Toes and If All the Animals Came Inside. Marc lives with his family in Tisbury, Martha&#39;s Vineyard.Looking a bit more like a valise than a lunch box, this 9" x 8" package opens to reveal a monster mom's idea of haute cuisine. The storybook inside introduces a gaggle of youngsters who discover "a smelly lunch box" and then proceed to clamber around its oversized contents. What they find would surely horrify Julia Child, but these tidbits are certain to tickle kids' funnybones. Among the many tasty treats are "lizard eyes, purple fries,/ three hankies filled with sneeze./ freeze-dried mice, donkey lice,/ a furry fish with fleas" (a bit of green fur contributes to the realism). Flaps, pull-tabs, simple pop-ups and even a hologram add to the repast's repulsiveness. As a garnish, there's a sheet of stickers of such entrees as Dirty Birdy Feet, Booger Custard, etc. Brown once again demonstrates his understanding of kids' humor as he serves up this gross-out du jour.

Now, in Natural History, she gives us her masterwork, a gorgeous display of storytelling - enchanting, bawdy, and profound.</p><p>A compelling tour de force, Howard's ( Expensive Habits ) latest novel shows this immensely talented writer at her inventive best. Her glance keen and her hand sure, Howard depicts the Irish Catholic Bray family: county detective Billy Bray, his gentility-obsessed wife Nell, their son, reckless and charming James, and their daughter, pious and pudgy Catherine. Howard gives their lives solidity and depth against the background of her own hometown, Bridgeport, Conn., a city so accurately and specifically rendered that readers with a map could pinpoint every reference to streets, restaurants, stores, churches and movie theaters; social nuances are revealed with equal clarity. The fuguelike first section traces the movements of each of the Brays on one Saturday during WW II, when James breezes through a clarinet lesson, Cath is humiliated at a Girl Scout jamboree, Nell strives to achieve family harmony and Billy becomes involved in a sensational murder case in which a society woman shoots a soldier home on leave. Echoes of James Joyce become more resonant in the novel's middle section, where Howard switches to a cinematic, elliptical narrative device as James, now an actor of middling success, returns to Bridgeport to make a movie about that notorious murder, but spinster Cath intends to foil his plan by revealing a family secret. As counterpoint to this deliberately fragmented narrative, on alternate (facing) pages, is a long, loosely constructed series of vignettes that encapsulate Bridgeport's history and decline, along with tart comments about the novel's characters (who include a nun turned social worker, a vulgar movie producer and James's valiant wife, an ex-rodeo queen). The section reproduces newspaper clippings about the Park City's famous sons (P. T. Barnum, Walt Kelley, Robert Mitchum); quotations from the likes of Freud, Lewis Mumford and William James; literary allusions slipped in without pretension; and 30 photos and line drawings. It is a kind of intellectual doodling--idiosyncratic and whimsical. Howard tells readers that they have "no obligation" to read the insert; "when it is unamusing, just go on . . . with the story." Howard's vigorous prose--at once earthy and sophisticated--is a graceful, arresting mix of metaphor and demotic idiom, ironic humor and glistening images, all employed in astute observation of her cultural and intellectual world. If the cinematic format and the flip, clipped narration tend to hold the reader at an emotional remove, the work is made buoyant by the larky digression, yet effectively anchored by the traditionally narrated sections. In form and substance, this powerful novel places Howard squarely among the outstanding practitioners of late-20th-century fiction. 35,000 first printing; major ad promo; author tour. (Nov.) .<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.With analytic eye but forgiving heart, Howard relates the tortured history of the Brays, an Irish-American family living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, at the close of World War II. As adults, James and Catherine leave home but cannot come to terms with their lives, for they are trapped in the shadow of their bigger-than-life father. Howard wraps this story in a virtuoso display of literary fireworks: Conventional narrative alternates with filmic montage and actor's monolog, and a long section juxtaposes the storyline with facts and myths about Bridgeport notables, among them P.T. Barnum, Robert Mitchum, and Walt Kelly of Pogo fame. Unfortunately, these experimental parts do not always work, and they seem peripheral to the central action. Comparison with William Kennedy's Ironweed is inevitable but misleading. Whereas Kennedy's seemingly effortless experimentation works to unfold character and nudge along the story, Howard's virtuosity often intrudes; the seams show, detracting from the narrative strength of an otherwise fine novel.

In outward form, <b>Number9Dream</b> is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister&#x2019;s death and his mother&#x2019;s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses&#x2014;through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck&#x2014;a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father&#x2019;s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.</p><p>David Mitchell's second novel, <i>Number9Dream</i>, tells the story of Eiji Miyake, a young man negotiating a hypermodern and dangerous Tokyo to meet for the first time his secretive and powerful father. Na�ve and fresh from the Japanese countryside, Eiji encounters every obstacle imaginable in his quest, from his father's--and in-laws'--reluctance for the encounter to occur (Eiji is the bastard son) to fiery entanglements with <i>yakuza</i> (the Japanese mafia) to the overwhelming size and anonymity of Tokyo itself. <p> The novel is cartoonish in that Eiji has a vivid and violent imagination that fills the book with daydreams. When not chain-smoking, forlorn Eiji wanders the city following vague or cryptic leads that invariably dead-end or land him back among yakuza. Mitchell (author of the critically acclaimed <i>Ghostwritten</i>) has a smart, eclectic writing style that seems foreign, and the novel is well paced, but the yakuza encounters are too cinematic, complete with unusual torture and pyrotechnics. Moreover, in addition to Eiji's daydreams, the last half of the book contains excerpts from the diaries of his great uncle's World War II naval heroics and bizarre short stories that Eiji reads while hiding--the latter of which make for tedious reading. </p><p> <i>Number9Dream</i> is crafted from too many disparate components; it does not seem to be a full expression, but an overly crowded one. Readers will sympathize with Eiji and his search, but in the end will wonder what effect, if any, all the extraneous forces had on him. The book provides many fun moments, but ultimately it doesn't really add up to the sum of its parts. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><br>Praise for David Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Ghostwritten</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell . . . has a gift for fiction&#x2019;s natural pleasures&#x2014;intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell is a fabulous ghostwriter fueled by a brilliant imagination and buoyed by beautifully descriptive writing. <i>Ghostwritten </i>is a brave new book for a brave new world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;To complement its heady themes, G<i>hostwritten</i> is also elegantly composed, gracefully plotted, and full of humor. . . . [It] recall[s] Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in its emotional scope and its ambitions. Like the great Russians, Mitchell makes us feel that more is at stake than individual lives, although it&#x2019;s by individual lives that pain and loss are measured.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;An intricately assembled Faberg� egg of a novel, full of sly and sometimes beautiful surprises. . . . In an era in which much literary fiction is characterized by unearned ironies and glib cynicism, it&#x2019;s hard not to be impressed by the humanism that animates Mitchell&#x2019;s book. . . . Worth a dozen of the morally anorexic novels that regularly come down the pipe.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Daniel Mendelsohn, <i>New York</i> magazine<br><br>&#x201c;Reminiscent at times of DeLillo, Murakami, and science fiction, especially in its continual probing of what is real and what is not, this book remains very much its own thing. . . . It is a thrill to read a piece of fiction this engrossing, challenging, urgent, and ultimately, so very new.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unlike so many other chroniclers of the twenty-first-century pastiche&#x2014;an industry dominated by ad men and feature-writers, not novelists&#x2014;Mitchell has set out to craft actual characters, not archetypes. The result is a dazzling piece of work.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i> <br><br>&#x201c;This is one of the best first novels I&#x2019;ve read for a long time. . . . I read a proof of this on a transatlantic flight. When I got off in Atlanta, I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. I pulled my luggage in one hand along corridors and escalators, and held David Mitchell&#x2019;s last chapter up to my nose with the other. I finished at the carousel. It seemed appropriate.

He perched on the blue roof of Moomin house and cuckooed eight times&#x2014;rather hoarsely to be sure, for it was still a bit early in the spring.<br>Then he flew away to the east.<br>Moomintroll woke up and lay a long time looking at the ceiling before he realized where he was. He had slept a hundred nights and a hundred days, and his dreams still thronged about his head trying to coax him back to sleep.<br>But as he was wriggling around trying to find a cozy new spot to sleep he caught sight of something that made him quite wide awake&#x2014;Snufkin&#x2019;s bed was empty!<br>Moomintroll sat up. Yes, Snufkin&#x2019;s hat had gone, too. &#x201c;Goodness gracious me!&#x201d; he said, tiptoeing to the open window. Ah-ha, Snufkin had been using the rope ladder. Moomintroll scrambled over the window-sill and climbed cautiously down on his short legs. He could see Snufkin&#x2019;s footprints plainly in the wet earth, wandering here and there and rather difficult to follow, until suddenly they did a long jump and crossed over themselves. &#x201c;He must have been very happy,&#x201d; decided Moomintroll. &#x201c;He did a somersault here&#x2014;that&#x2019;s clear enough.&#x201d;<br>Suddenly Moomintroll lifted his nose and listened. Far away Snufkin was playing his gayest song, &#x201c;All small beasts should have bows in their tails.&#x201d; And Moomintroll began to run toward the music.<br>Down by the river he came upon Snufkin who was sitting on the bridge with his legs dangling over the water, his old hat pulled down over his ears.<br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; said Moomintroll sitting down beside him.<br>&#x201c;Hello to you,&#x201d; said Snufkin, and went on playing.<br>The sun was up now and shone straight into their eyes, making them blink. They sat swinging their legs over the running water feeling happy and carefree.<br>They had had many strange adventures on this river and had brought home many new friends. Moomintroll&#x2019;s mother and father always welcomed all their friends in the same quiet way, just adding another bed and putting another leaf in the dining-room table. And so Moomin house was rather full&#x2014;a place where everyone did what they liked and seldom worried about tomorrow. Very often unexpected and disturbing things used to happen, but nobody ever had time to be bored, and that is always a good thing.<br>When Snufkin came to the last verse of his spring song he put his mouth-organ in his pocket and said:<br>&#x201c;Is Sniff awake yet?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; answered Moomintroll. &#x201c;He always sleeps a week longer than the others.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then we must certainly wake him up,&#x201d; said Snufkin as he jumped down. &#x201c;We must do something special today because it&#x2019;s going to be fine.&#x201d;<br>So Moomintroll made their secret signal under Sniff&#x2019;s window: three ordinary whistles first and then a long one through his paws, and it meant: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something doing.&#x201d; They heard Sniff stop snoring, but nothing moved up above.<br>&#x201c;Once more,&#x201d; said Snufkin. And they signaled even louder than before.<br>Then the window banged up.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m asleep,&#x201d; shouted a cross voice.<br>&#x201c;Come on down and don&#x2019;t be angry,&#x201d; said Snufkin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to do something very special.&#x201d;<br>Then Sniff smoothed out his sleep-crinkled ears and clambered down the rope ladder. (I should perhaps mention that they had rope ladders under all the windows because it took so long to use the stairs.)<br>It certainly promised to be a fine day. Everywhere befuddled little creatures just woken from their long winter sleep poked about rediscovering old haunts, and busied themselves airing clothes, brushing out their moustaches and getting their houses ready for the spring.<br>Many were building new homes and I am afraid some were quarrelling. (You can wake up in a very bad temper after such a long sleep.)<br>The Spirits that haunted the trees sat combing their long hair, and on the north side of the tree trunks, baby mice dug tunnels amongst the snow-flakes.<br>&#x201c;Happy Spring!&#x201d; said an elderly Earthworm. &#x201c;And how was the winter with you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very nice, thank you,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. &#x201c;Did you sleep well, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; said the Worm. &#x201c;Remember me to your father and mother.&#x201d;<br>So they walked on, talking to a lot of people in this way, but the higher up the hill they went the less people there were, and at last they only saw one or two mother mice sniffing around and spring-cleaning.<br>It was wet everywhere.<br>&#x201c;Ugh&#x2014;how nasty,&#x201d; said Moomintroll, picking his way gingerly through the melting snow. &#x201c;So much snow is never good for a Moomin. Mother said so.&#x201d; And he sneezed.<br>&#x201c;Listen, Moomintroll,&#x201d; said Snufkin. &#x201c;I have an idea. What about going to the top of the mountain and making a pile of stones to show that we were the first to get there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, let&#x2019;s,&#x201d; said Sniff, and set off at once so as to get there before the others.<br>When they reached the top the March wind gambolled around them, and the blue distance lay at their feet. To the west was the sea; to the east the river looped round the Lonely Mountains; to the north the great forest spread its green carpet, and to the south the smoke rose from Moomintroll&#x2019;s chimney, for Moominmamma was cooking the breakfast. But Sniff saw none of these things because on the top of the mountain lay a hat&#x2014;a tall, black hat.<br>&#x201c;Someone has been here before!&#x201d; he said.<br>Moomintroll picked up the hat and looked at it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a rarey hat,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps it will fit you, Snufkin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; said Snufkin, who loved his old green hat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s much too new.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps father would like it,&#x201d; mused Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;Well, anyway we&#x2019;ll take it with us,&#x201d; said Sniff. &#x201c;But now I want to go home&#x2014;I&#x2019;m dying for some breakfast, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I should just say I am,&#x201d; said Snufkin.And that was how they found the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat and took it home with them, without guessing for one moment that this would cast a spell on the Valley of the Moomins, and that before long they would all see strange things...<br>When Moomintroll, Snufkin and Sniff went out onto the verandah the others had already had their breakfast and gone off in various directions. Moominpappa was alone reading the newspaper.<br>&#x201c;Well, well! So you have woken up, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remarkably little in the paper today. A stream burst its dam and swamped a lot of ants. All saved. The first cuckoo arrived in the valley at four o&#x2019;clock and then flew off to the east.&#x201d; (This is a good omen, but a cuckoo flying west is still better... )<br>&#x201c;Look what we&#x2019;ve found,&#x201d; interrupted Moomintroll, proudly. &#x201c;A beautiful new top hat for you!&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa put aside his paper and examined the hat very thoroughly. Then he put it on in front of the long mirror. It was rather too big for him&#x2014;in fact it nearly covered his eyes, and the effect was very curious.<br>&#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; screamed Moomintroll. &#x201c;Come and look at Father.&#x201d;Moominmamma opened the kitchen door and looked at him with amazement.<br>&#x201c;How do I look?&#x201d; asked Moominpappa.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Moominmamma. &#x201c;Yes, you look very handsome in it, but it&#x2019;s just a tiny bit too big.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it better like this?&#x201d; asked Moominpappa, pushing the hat on to the back of his head.<br>&#x201c;Hm,&#x201d; said Moominmamma. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s smart, too, but I almost think you look more dignified without a hat.&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa looked at himself in front, behind and from both sides, and then he put the hat on the table with a sigh.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some people look better without hats.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, dear,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, kindly. &#x201c;Now eat up your eggs, children, you need feeding up after living on pine needles all the winter.&#x201d; And she disappeared into the kitchen again.<br>&#x201c;But what shall we do with the hat?&#x201d; asked Sniff. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s such a fine one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Use it as a waste paper basket,&#x201d; said Moominpappa, and thereupon he took himself upstairs to go on writing his life story. (The heavy volume about his stormy youth.)<br>Snufkin put the hat down on the floor between the table and the kitchen door. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve got a new piece of furniture again,&#x201d; he said, grinning, for Snufkin could never understand why people liked to have things. He was quite happy wearing the old suit he had had since he was born (nobody knows when and where that happened), and the only possession he didn&#x2019;t give away was his mouth-organ.<br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve finished breakfast we&#x2019;ll go and see how the Snorks are getting on,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. But before going out into the garden he threw his eggshell into the wastepaper basket, for he was (sometimes) a well brought up Moomin.<br>The dining room was now empty.<br>In the corner between the table and the kitchen door stood the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat with the eggshell in the bottom. And then something really strange happened. The eggshell began to change its shape.<br>(This is what happens, you see. If something lies long enough in the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat it begins to change into something quite different&#x2014;what that will be you never know beforehand. It was lucky that the hat hadn&#x2019;t fitted Moominpappa because the-Protector-of-all-Small-Beasts knows what woul...</p></p><h2>Fuse It - 18 Fused Glass Projects</h2><p>OUT OF STOCK - 'Fuse It' from Wardell Publications Fused Art Glass reintroduces Petra Kaiser, author of the popular book, Introduction To Glass Fusing, presents Fuse It, a continuing journey in kiln worked glass.

Salvatore's phenomenally popular twin-scimitar-swinger, you won't be disappointed. <i>The Silent Blade</i> is old-school Drizzt, an adventure that brings together the original gang: the lovely Cattie-brie, the plump and mischievous Regis, the gruff dwarven father- figure Bruenor, and the even more gruff barbarian hammer-hurler Wulfgar. Better yet, <i>The Silent Blade</i> brings back Drizzt's best worst nemesis, master assassin Artemis Entreri. Throw in the evil artefact Crenshinibon (a.k.a. the Crystal Shard, the namesake of the first Drizzt Do'Urden book), and you know you're in for a good time. <p> The plot follows three intertwined threads: Drizzt and Co.'s road trip to destroy Crenshinibon, Wulfgar's struggle to overcome the scars of his imprisonment at the claws of the demon Errtu and Artemis Entreri's long-awaited return to the seamy streets of Calimport. The action is as lively as ever, with giants and goblins and thieves all getting their deserved lumps at the hands of our heroes, and of course Drizzt continues his meditations on life with a capital L. The book's highlight, though, comes when Do'Urden and Entreri cross paths once again, this time with surprising results. And the promise of that match-up should keep you flipping the pages quickly. --<i>Paul Hughes, Amazon.com</i></p>R.A.

No one is spared in frank, uncensored and frequently hilarious conversations about the stone age of broadcasting -- the 1930s, &#39;40s and &#39;50s -- when advertising agencies controlled the programs, stars ran amok and writers were treated with profound disrespect, like a necessary evil.</p><p>I live in the past, and I readily admit it. In fact, I've made a career out of it. I would love to have written comedy for radio in its heyday. Having grown up during the television era -- Jack Benny made his TV debut the week I was born -- I did not have this opportunity. As a show business historian, however, I have been able to live this dream vicariously, interviewing many of those who did. <p>For an oral history of radio drama (a work-in-progress at this time) I have interrogated a number of comedy writers about their work in radio and early television. And while I have sat at the feet of countless actors, comedians, musicians, announcers, producers and other industry veterans, the writers were a revelation. They proved, invariably, to be the best raconteurs and the most articulate interview subjects. </p><p>While screenwriters have finally won a measure of recognition in recent years, far less attention has been paid the writers of radio and television's Golden Age. Several of the writers featured in this book have been celebrated for their creative efforts of the 1960s and '70s, but most have seldom, if ever, talked about their work in the early days of broadcasting -- the '30s, '40s and '50s -- a decidedly different era of popular culture that has been largely forgotten. </p><p>I have been a lover of comedy and comedians all my life. This book may present a somewhat unflattering portrait of some of my favorite entertainers. But as we know, there are at least two sides to every story. Behind every successful radio and TV comic was a hard-working writer -- or a platoon of them -- who toiled in virtual anonymity. It is high time these invisible comedians took a bow. </p><p>These interviews were conducted between 1990 and 1995. Many of the subjects required little or no prodding, and since my philosophy as an interviewer is simply, "shut up and listen," and I let them go right on talking. I have edited the interview transcripts only slightly and rephrased next to nothing.</p>"Jordan Young has performed an excellent -- and long overdue -- examination of the men who made millions and millions of Americans laugh, only to wind up as Writers Anonymous." -- Larry Gelbart. <p>"Jordan Young's 'The Laugh Crafters' is enjoyable for its spark, spunk and humor, but there are also sobering insights into the exploitation of comedy writers in the early days of radio, when royal talents were treated like serfs, by ego-fixated comedians and feral producers. This book is a Must with a capital M for writers and a Should with a capital S for the general reader." -- Norman Corwin. </p><p>"In the emerging history of radio, 'The Laugh Crafters' is a welcome piece of work. Jordan Young interviews a dozen of radio's best comedy writers, and what emerges is oral history of the first order. These guys were unsung heroes behind such brand names as Jack Benny, Fibber McGee, Bob Hope and Red Skelton. They've been given short shrift in all the books on radio, but here Young lets them speak for themselves. Together they tell a story that is rich, not only with who-wrote-what details, but with the rough-and-tumble way of life of the comedy writer in radio's glory years." -- John Dunning, author of "On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio."</p></p><h2>Star Wars: Cloak of Deception</h2><p><b><i>From </i>New York Times<i> bestselling author James Luceno comes an all-new </i>Star Wars<i> adventure that reveals the action and intrigue unfolding directly before Episode I</i>: The Phantom Menace<i>.</i></b><br><br>Mired in greed and corruption, tangled in bureaucracy, the Galactic Republic is crumbling. In the outlying systems, where the Trade Federation maintains a stranglehold on shipping routes, tensions are boiling over?while back in the comfort of Coruscant, the hub of civilized space and seat of the Republic government, few senators seem inclined to investigate the problem. And those who suspect Supreme Chancellor Valorum of having a hand in the machinations are baffled?especially when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi foil an assassination attempt on the Chancellor. <br><br>With the crisis escalating, Valorum calls for an emergency trade summit. As humans and aliens gather, conspiracies sealed with large sums of money run rampant, and no one is entirely above suspicion. But the greatest threat of all remains unknown to everyone except three members of the Trade Federation who have entered into a shadowy alliance with a dark overlord. While the trio will be content with more money and fewer problems, Darth Sidious has grander, far more terrifying plans.<br><br>It is a time that tests the mettle of all those who strive to hold the Republic together?none more so than the Jedi Knights, who have long been the galaxy's best hope for preserving peace and justice. Yet despite their most valiant efforts, the meeting will explode into fiery chaos beyond everyone?s worst fears . . .</p><p><b>James Luceno </b>is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the <i>Star Wars</i> novels <i>Millennium Falcon, Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, Cloak of Deception, Labyrinth of Evil,</i> as well as the New Jedi Order novels <i>Agents of Chaos I: Hero&#x2019;s Trial </i>and<i> Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse, The Unifying Force, </i>and the eBook <i>Darth Maul: Saboteur</i>. He is also the author of the fantasy novel <i>Hunt for the Mayan Looking-Glass</i>, available as an eBook.&nbsp;He lives in Annapolis, Maryland, with his wife and youngest child.The four walls of Finis Valorum's office, at the summit of the<br>governmental district's stateliest if not most statuesque edifice, were<br>made of transparisteel, paneled by structural members into a continuous<br>band of regular and inverted triangles.<br><br>The city-planet that was Coruscant--"Scintillant Orb," "Jewel of the<br>Core," choked heart of the Galactic Republic--spread to all sides in a<br>welter of lustrous domes, knife-edged spires, and terraced<br>superstructures that climbed to the sky. The taller buil-ings resembled<br>outsize rocketships that had never left their launch pads, or the<br>wind-eroded lava tors of long-dead volcanoes. Some of the domes were<br>flattened hemispheres perched on cylindrical bases, while others had the<br>look of shallow, hand-thrown ceramic bowls with finialed lids.<br><br>Striations of magnetically guided sky traffic moved swiftly above the<br>cityscape--streams of transports, air buses, taxis, and limousines,<br>coursing between the tall spires and over the mesureless chasms like<br>schools of exotic fish. Instead of feeding, however, they were the<br>feeders, distributing the galaxy's wealth among the greedy trillion to<br>whom Coruscant was home.<br><br>As often as Valorum had beheld the view--which was to say, nearly every<br>day of his now seven years as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic--he had<br>yet to grow indifferent to the spectacle of Coruscant. As worlds went,<br>it was neither large nor especially rugged, but history had transformed<br>it into a uniquely vertical place, a vertical experience more common to<br>ocean than atmospheric life.<br><br>Valorum's principal office was located in the lower level of the<br>Galactic Senate dome, but he was generally so swamped by requests and<br>business there that he reserved this lofty perch for meetings of a more<br>private nature.<br><br>Pale hands clasped at his back, he stood at the bank of transparisteel<br>windows that faced the dawn, though daybreak was hours behind him. He<br>wore a magenta tunic that was high-collared and double-breasted, with<br>matching trousers and a wide cummerbund. Southern light, polarized by<br>the transparisteel panels, flooded the room. But Valorum's sole guest<br>had taken a seat well out of the light's reach.<br><br>"I fear, Supreme Chancellor, that we face a monumental challenge,"<br>Senator Palpatine was saying from the shadows. "Frayed at its far-flung<br>borders and hollowed at its very heart by corruption, the Republic is in<br>grave danger of unraveling. Order is needed, directives that will<br>restore balance. Even the most desperate remedies should not be<br>overlooked."<br><br>Although such opinions had become the common sentiment, Palpatine's<br>words pierced Valorum like a sword. The fact that he knew them to be<br>true made them all the more difficult to hear. He turned his back to the<br>view and returned to his desk, where he sat heavily into his padded<br>chair.<br><br>Aging with distinction, Valorum had a receding cap of shorn silver hair,<br>pouches under piercing blue eyes, and dark, bushy brows. His stern<br>features and deep voice belied a compassionate spirit and questing<br>intellect. But as the latest in the line of a po-litical dynasty that<br>stretched back thousands of years--a dynasty many thought weakened by its<br>uncommon longevity--he had never been fully successful at overcoming an<br>innate patrician aloofness.<br><br>"Where have we gone wrong?" he asked in a firm but sad voice. "How did<br>we manage to miss the portents along the way?"<br><br>Palpatine showed him an understanding look. "The fault is not in<br>ourselves, Supreme Chancellor. The fault lies in the out-lying star<br>systems, and the civil strife iniquity has engendered there." His voice<br>was carefully modulated, occasionally world-weary, seemingly immune to<br>anger or alarm. "This most recent situation at Dorvalla, for example."<br><br>Valorum nodded soberly. "The Judicial Department has re-quested that I<br>meet with them later today, so they can brief me on the latest<br>developments."<br><br>"Perhaps I could save you the trouble, Supreme Chancellor. As least in<br>terms of what I've been hearing in the senate." "Rumor or facts?"<br><br>"A bit of both, I suspect. The senate is filled with delegates who<br>interpret matters as they will, regardless of facts." Palpatine paused,<br>as if to gather his thoughts.<br><br>Prominent in a kind if somewhat doughy face were his heavy-lidded,<br>watery blue eyes and rudder of a nose. Red hair that had lost its youth<br>he wore in the provincial style of the outlying systems: combed back<br>from his high forehead but left thick and long behind his low-set ears.<br>In dress, too, he demonstrated singular allegiance to his home system,<br>favoring embroidered tunics with V-shaped double collars and outmoded<br>cloaks of quilted fabric.<br><br>A sectorial senator representing the outlying world of Na-boo, along<br>with thirty-six other inhabited planets, Palpatine had earned a<br>reputation for integrity and frankness that had set him high in the<br>hearts of many of his senatorial peers. As he had made clear to Valorum<br>in numerous meetings, both public and private, he was more interested in<br>doing whatever needed to be done than in blind obedience to the rules<br>and regulations that had made the senate such a tangle of procedures.<br><br>"As the Judicial Department is certain to tell you," he began at last,<br>"the mercenaries who assaulted and destroyed the Trade Federation vessel<br>Revenue were in the employ of the Nebula Front terrorist group. It seems<br>likely that they gained access to the freighter with the complicity of<br>dockworkers at Dorvalla. How the Nebula Front learned that the freighter<br>was carrying a fortune in aurodium ingots has yet to be established. But<br>clearly the Nebula Front planned to use the aurodium to finance<br>additional acts of terrorism directed against the Trade Federation, and<br>perhaps against Republic colonies in the Outer Rim."<br><br>"Planned?" Valorum said.<br><br>"All indications are that Captain Cohl and his team of assassins<br>perished in the explosion that destroyed the Revenue. But the incident<br>has had wide-ranging repercussions, nevertheless."<br><br>"I'm well aware of some of those," Valorum said, with a note of disgust.<br>"As a result of continuing raids and harassment, the Trade Federation<br>plans to demand Republic intervention, or, failing that, senate approval<br>to further augment their droid contingent."<br><br>Palpatine made his lips a thin line and nodded. "I must confess, Supreme<br>Chancellor, that my first instinct was to refuse their requests out of<br>hand. The Trade Federation is already too powerful--in wealth and in<br>military might. However, I've since reassessed my position."<br><br>Valorum regarded him with interest. "I'd appreciate hearing your<br>thoughts."<br><br>"Well, to begin with, the Trade Federation is made up of entrepreneurs,<br>not warriors. The Neimoidians, especially, are cowards in any theater<br>other than commerce. So granting them permission to enlarge their droid<br>defenses--slightly, at any rate-- doesn't concern me unduly. More<br>important, there may be some advantage to doing so."<br><br>Valorum interlocked his fingers and leaned forward. "What possible<br>advantage?"<br><br>Palpatine took a breath. "In exchange for honoring their re-quests for<br>intervention and additional defenses, the senate would be in a position<br>to demand that all trade in the outlying systems would henceforth be<br>subject to Republic taxation." Valorum sat back in his chair, clearly<br>disappointed. "We've been through all this before, Senator. You and I<br>both know that a majority of the senate has no interest in what happens<br>in the outer systems, much less in the free trade zones. But they do<br>care about what happens to the Trade Federation."<br><br>"Yes, because the shimmersilk pockets of many a senatorial robe are<br>being lined with graft from the Neimoidians." Valorum snorted.<br>"Self-indulgence is the order of the day." "Undeniably so, Supreme<br>Chancellor," Palpatine said tolerantly. "But that, in itself, is no<br>reason to allow the practice to continue."<br><br>"Of course not," Valorum said. "For both my terms of office I have<br>sought to end the corruption that plagues the senate, and to unravel the<br>knot of policies and procedures that thwart us. We enact legislation,<br>only to find that we cannot implement it. The committees proliferate<br>like viruses, without leadership. No fewer than twenty committees are<br>needed just to determine the decor of the senate corridors.<br><br>"The Trade Federation has prospered by taking advantage of the very<br>bureaucracy we've created. Grievances brought against the Federation<br>languish in the courts, while commissions belabor each and every aspect.<br>It's little wonder that Dorvalla and many of the worlds along the Rimma<br>Trade Route support terrorist groups like the Nebula Front.<br><br>"But taxation isn't likely to solve anything. In fact, such a move could<br>prompt the Trade Federation to abandon the outlying systems entirely, in<br>favor of more lucrative markets closer to the Core."<br><br>"Thus depriving Coruscant and its neighbors of important outer system<br>resources and luxury goods," Palpatine interjected, seemingly by rote.<br>"Certainly the Neimoidians will see taxation as a betrayal, if for no<br>other reason than the Trade Federation blazed many of the hyperspace<br>routes that link the Core to the outlying systems. Regardless, this<br>could be the opportunity many of us have waited for--the chance to<br>exercise senate control over those very trade routes."<br><br>Valorum mulled it over briefly.

It was the first novel by a Georgian to win a Pulitzer, soon followed by Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND in 1937. In fact, LAMB was largely responsible for the discovery of GONE WITH THE WIND; after reading Miller's novel, Macmillan editor Harold S. Latham sought out other southern novels and authors, and found Margaret Mitchell. <p>Caroline Miller was fascinated by the other Old South-not the romantic inhabitant of GONE WITH THE WIND, but rather the poor people of the south Georgia backwoods, who never owned a slave or planned to fight a war. The story of Cean and Lonzo, a young couple who begin their married lives two decades before the Civil War, LAMB IN HIS BOSOM is a fascinating account of social customs and material realities among settlers of the Georgia frontier.

Shortly after graduating from high school, she married William D. Miller, her high school English teacher, and had three children. She began traveling through rural south Georgia, interviewing the people she met and planning a novel; as she had not attended college, her husband taught her about literature. "He was my college," she said. <p>The success of LAMB IN HIS BOSOM and her resulting celebrity after winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1934 made it difficult for her to resume her former life in Baxley. She and her husband divorced, and she moved to Biloxi, Mississippi, and then to Waynesville, North Carolina. She remarried and had two more children. Her second novel, LEBANON, was published in 1944. </p><p>Caroline Miller died in Waynesville in 1992.

Reprint.</p><p>A large part of the pleasure of having Richard Stark back writing about the master criminal Parker is the obvious delight that Stark (a pen name for Donald Westlake) takes in doing the research for his capers. This one must have been a blast. Certainly, he must have spent time on board a cruise ship to get all the inside details for Parker's planned robbery of a fictional floating casino called the <i>Spirit of the Hudson</i>--details such as how to get the cash off (inside a wheelchair's converted potty seat) or how to make use of a hard-shelled female publicist.<p> Then there must have been a tour of old towns along the Hudson, to come up with this letter-perfect description of a seedy saloon: "It was called the Lido, but it shouldn't have been. It was an old bar, a gray wood cube cut deep into the ground floor of a narrow 19th Century brick house, and at two on a sunny afternoon in April it was dark and dry, smelling of old whiskey and dead wood.... At the bar, muttering together about sports and politics--other people's victories and defeats--were nine or ten shabbily dressed guys who were older than their teeth."</p><p> After <i>Comeback</i> (Parker's triumphant return to action after a 20-year hiatus), readers know that all the best planning in the world can't account for fate or human weakness. This time, a weirdly motivated retired civil servant, an out-of-control smalltown cop, and some greedy bikers stand in the way of Parker and Co.'s successful removal of $400,000 from the gambling boat. Stark is too gifted an artist to make their intervention trivial, and also too talented an entertainer to leave his old and new Parker fans unsatisfied with the outcome. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Richard Stark, aka Donald E. Westlake (1933&#x2013;2008), wrote dozens of novels under his own name and a rainbow of other pseudonyms. Many of his books have been adapted for film, most notably <i>The Hunter,</i> which became the 1967 noir <i>Point Blank,</i> and the 1999 smash <i>Payback.</i><br><br></p><h2>More Matter: Essays and Criticism</h2><p>John Updike's fiftieth book and fifth collection of assorted prose, most of it first published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, brings together eight years' worth of essays, criticism, addresses, introductions, humorous feuilletons, and -- in a concluding section, "Personal Matters" -- paragraphs on himself and his work. More matter, indeed, in an age which, his introduction states, wants "real stuff -- the dirt, the poop, the nitty gritty -- and not . . . the obliquities and tenuosities of fiction." <br><br>Still, the fiction writer's affectionate, shaping hand can be detected in many of these considerations. Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, Sinclair Lewis, Dawn Powell, Henry Green, John Cheever, Vladimir Nabokov, and W. M. Spackman are among the authors extensively treated, along with such more general literary matters as the nature of evil, the philosophical content of novels, and the wreck of the Titanic. Biographies of Isaac Newton and Queen Elizabeth II, Abraham Lincoln and Nathaniel Hawthorne, Robert Benchley and Helen Keller, are reviewed, always with a lively empathy. Two especially scholarly disquisitions array twentieth-century writing about New York City and sketch the ancient linkage between religion and literature. An illustrated section contains sharp-eyed impressions of movies, photographs, and art. Even the slightest of these pieces can twinkle.<br><br>Updike is a writer for whom print is a mode of happiness: he says of his younger self, "The magazine rack at the corner drugstore beguiled me with its tough gloss," and goes on to claim, "An invitation into print, from however suspect a source, is an opportunity to make something beautiful, to discover within oneself a treasure that would otherwise have remained buried."</p><p>Ever since he made his two-pronged prose debut in 1959 with <i>The Poorhouse Fair</i> and <i>The Same Door</i>, John Updike has delivered approximately one work of fiction per year. Few modern novelists have approached this level of productivity, which suggests a kind of late-Victorian stamina and linguistic lust for life. Even fewer have simultaneously churned out, as Updike has, a constant stream of reviews, essays, reminiscences, and occasional pieces. His custom is to collect this abundance every decade or so, disguising the substantial nature of these volumes with throwaway titles like <i>Picked-Up Pieces</i> and <i>Odd Jobs</i>. The latest such cornucopia is <i>More Matter</i>--and, like its predecessors, this 928-page behemoth reminds us that Updike is among our most discerning and omnivorous critics.<p> His title, this time, echoes Queen Gertrude's editorial advice to Polonius: "More matter, with less art." Only reluctantly does Updike assent to our age's appetite for facts, facts, and more facts, with fiction relegated to a kind of imaginative finger bowl: </p><blockquote>Human curiosity, the abettor and stimulant of the fiction surge between Robinson Crusoe's adventures and Constance Chatterley's, has become ever more literal-minded and impatient with the proxies of the imagination. Present taste runs to the down-home divulgences of the talk show--psychotherapeutic confession turned into public circus--and to investigative journalism that, like so many heat-seeking missiles, seeks out the intimate truths, the very genitals, of Presidents and princesses.</blockquote> Strong stuff, that last line, especially from the man whom Nicholson Baker called "the first novelist to take the penile sensorium under the wing of elaborate metaphoric prose."<p> But if Updike's critical investigations tend to stay above the belt, they remain as wide-ranging and elegant as ever. In <i>More Matter</i>, he takes on Herman Melville and Mickey Mouse, Abraham Lincoln and the male body--not to mention the cream of modern cosmology. His formulations on almost any subject seem ripe for the commonplace book. Here he is on sexual appetite: "Lust, which begins in a glance of the eye, is a searching, and its consummation, step by step, a knowing." On the short story: "The inner spaces that a good short story lets us enter are the old apartments of religion." On the austerity of biblical narrative: "The original Gospels evince a flinty terseness, a refusal, or inability, to provide the close focus and cinematic highlighting that the modern mind expects." And finally, on the raw intimacies of John Cheever's published journals: </p><blockquote>His confessions posthumously administer a Christian lesson in the deep gulf between outward appearance and inward condition; they present, with an almost unbearable fullness, a post-Adamic man, an unreconciled bundle of cravings and complaints, whose consolations--the glory of the sky, the company of his young sons--have the ring of hollow cheer in the vastness of his dissatisfaction. Comparatively, the journals of Kierkegaard and Emerson are complacent and academic.</blockquote> These sentences neatly unite the author's literary and theological concerns--although the latter topic takes something of a back seat in <i>More Matter</i>--and remind us of the compound pleasures of his prose. In his preface, Updike refers to the book as "my fifth such collection and--dare we hope?--my last." We very much hope not. <i>--James Marcus</i>"MORE MATTER ATTESTS TO MR. UPDIKE'S REMARKABLE VERSATILITY AND TO HIS ARDENT DRIVE TO TURN ALL HIS OBSERVATIONS INTO GLITTERING, GOSSAMER PROSE . . .

Dick&#x2019;s VALIS trilogy, <i>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</i> brings the author&#x2019;s search for the identity and nature of God to a close. The novel follows Bishop Timothy Archer as he travels to Israel, ostensibly to examine ancient scrolls bearing the words of Christ. But, more importantly, this leads him to examine the decisions he made during his life and how they may have contributed to the suicide of his mistress and son.<br> This introspective book is one of Dick&#x2019;s most philosophical and literary, delving into the mysteries of religion and of faith itself. As one of Dick&#x2019;s final works, it also provides unique insight into the mind of a genius, whose work was still in the process of maturing at the time of his death.<br><br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928&#x2013;1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>.<br><br>ansmigration of Timothy Archer, the final novel in the trilogy that also includes <i>Valis</i> and <i>The Divine Invasion</i>, is an anguished, learned, and very moving investigation of the paradoxes of belief. It is the story of Timothy Archer, an urbane Episcopal bishop haunted by the suicides of his son and mistress--and driven by them into a bizarre quest for the identity of Christ.</p><h2>How to Paint Like the Impressionists: A Practical Guide to Re-Creating Your Own Impressionist Paintings</h2><p><p>Impressionism has captured the imagination of people the world over since its first exhibition in Paris in 1874.

The face wore a grimace of surprise, as if the man had died in the middle of a scream. His teeth, each clearly divided from its neighbor by a black line, were bared in a horrible, silent scream.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the thing.<br><br>The woman who proudly held the gaping head at arm&#x2019;s length by its curly blue-�black hair was wearing a scarlet dress&#x2014;�almost, but not quite, the color of the dead man&#x2019;s blood.<br><br>To one side, a servant with downcast eyes held the platter upon which she had carried the head into the room. Seated on a wooden throne, a matron in a saffron dress leaned forward in square-�jawed pleasure, her hands clenched into fists on the arms of her chair as she took a good look at the grisly trophy. Her name was Herodias, and she was the wife of the king.<br><br>The younger woman, the one clutching the head, was&#x2014;at least, according to the historian Flavius Josephus&#x2014;named Salome. She was the stepdaughter of the king, whose name was Herod, and Herodias was her mother.<br><br>The detached head, of course, belonged to John the Baptist.<br><br>I remembered hearing the whole sordid story not more than a month ago when Father read aloud the Second Lesson from the back of the great carved wooden eagle which served as the lectern at St. Tancred&#x2019;s.<br><br>On that winter morning I had gazed up, transfixed, just as I was gazing now, at the stained-�glass window in which this fascinating scene was depicted.<br><br>Later, during his sermon, the vicar had explained that in Old Testament times, our blood was thought to contain our lives.<br><br>Of course!<br><br>Blood!<br><br>Why hadn&#x2019;t I thought of it before?<br><br>&#x201c;Feely,&#x201d; I said, tugging at her sleeve, &#x201c;I have to go home.&#x201d;<br><br>My sister ignored me. She peered closely at the music book as, in the dusky shadows of the fading light, her fingers flew like white birds over the keys of the organ.<br><br>Mendelssohn&#x2019;s Wie gross ist des Allm�cht&#x2019;gen G�te.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;How great are the works of the Almighty,&#x2019; &#x201d; she told me it meant.<br><br>Easter was now less than a week away and Feely was trying to whip the piece into shape for her official debut as organist of St. Tancred&#x2019;s. The flighty Mr. Collicutt, who had held the post only since last summer, had vanished suddenly from our village without explanation and Feely had been asked to step into his shoes.<br><br>St. Tancred&#x2019;s went through organists like a python goes through white mice. Years ago, there had been Mr. Taggart, then Mr. Denning. It was now Mr. Collicutt&#x2019;s kick at the cat.<br><br>&#x201c;Feely,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important. There&#x2019;s something I have to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Feely jabbed one of the ivory coupling buttons with her thumb and the organ gave out a roar. I loved this part of the piece: the point where it leaps in an instant from sounding like a quiet sea at sunset to the snarl of a jungle animal.<br><br>When it comes to organ music, loud is good&#x2014;�at least to my way of thinking.<br><br>I tucked my knees up under my chin and huddled back into the corner of the choir stall. It was obvious that Feely was going to slog her way through to the end come hell or high water, and I would simply have to wait it out.<br><br>I looked at my surroundings but there wasn&#x2019;t much to see. In the feeble glow of the single bulb above the music rack, Feely and I might as well have been castaways on a tiny raft of light in a sea of darkness.<br><br>By twisting my neck and tilting my head back like a hanged man, I could just make out the head of Saint Tancred, which was carved in English oak at the end of a hammer beam in the roof of the nave. In the weird evening light, he had the look of a man with his nose pressed flat against a window, peering in from the cold to a cozy room with a cheery fire burning on the hearth.<br><br>I gave him a respectful bob of my head, even though I knew he couldn&#x2019;t see me since his bones were moldering away in the crypt below. But better safe than sorry.<br><br>Above my head, on the far side of the chancel, John the Baptist and his murderers had now faded out almost completely. Twilight came quickly in these cloudy days of March and, viewed from inside the church, the windows of St. Tancred&#x2019;s could change from a rich tapestry of glorious colors to a muddy blackness in less time than it would take you to rattle off one of the longer psalms.<br><br>To tell the truth, I&#x2019;d have rather been at home in my chemical laboratory than sitting here in the near-�darkness of a drafty old church, but Father had insisted.<br><br>Even though Feely was six years older than me, Father refused to let her go alone to the church for her almost nightly rehearsals and choir practices.<br><br>&#x201c;A lot of strangers likely to be about these days,&#x201d; he said, referring to the team of archaeologists who would soon be arriving in Bishop&#x2019;s Lacey to dig up the bones of our patron saint.<br><br>How I was to defend Feely against the attacks of these savage scholars, Father had not bothered to mention, but I knew there was more to it than that.<br><br>In the recent past there had been a number of murders in Bishop&#x2019;s Lacey: fascinating murders in which I had rendered my assistance to Inspector Hewitt of the Hinley Constabulary.<br><br>In my mind, I ticked off the victims on my fingers: Horace Bonepenny, Rupert Porson, Brookie Harewood, Phyllis Wyvern. . . .<br><br>One more corpse and I&#x2019;d have a full hand.<br><br>Each of them had come to a sticky end in our village, and I knew that Father was uneasy.<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t right, Ophelia,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;for a girl who&#x2019;s&#x2014;�for a girl your age to be rattling about alone in an old church at night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nobody there but the dead.&#x201d; Feely had laughed, perhaps a little too gaily. &#x201c;And they don&#x2019;t bother me. Not nearly so much as the living.&#x201d;<br><br>Behind Father&#x2019;s back, my other sister, Daffy, had licked her wrist and wetted down her hair on both sides of an imaginary part in the middle of her head, like a cat washing its face. She was poking fun at Ned Cropper, the potboy at the Thirteen Drakes, who had the most awful crush on Feely and sometimes followed her about like a bad smell.<br><br>Feely had scratched her ear to indicate she had understood Daffy&#x2019;s miming. It was one of those silent signals that fly among sisters like semaphore messages from ship to ship, indecipherable to anyone who doesn&#x2019;t know the code. Even if Father had seen the gesture, he would not have understood its meaning. Father&#x2019;s codebook was in a far different language from ours.<br><br>&#x201c;Still,&#x201d; Father had said, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;re coming or going after dark, you are to take Flavia with you. It won&#x2019;t hurt her to learn a few hymns.&#x201d;<br><br>Learn a few hymns indeed! Just a couple of months ago when I was confined to bed during the Christmas holidays, Mrs. Mullet, in giggling whispers and hushed pledges of secrecy, had taught me a couple of new ones. I never tired of bellowing:<br><br>&#x201c;Hark the herald angels sing,<br><br>Beecham&#x2019;s Pills are just the thing.<br><br>Peace on earth and mercy mild,<br><br>Two for a man and one for a child!&#x201d;<br><br>Either that or:<br><br>&#x201c;We Three Kings of Leicester Square,<br><br>Selling ladies&#x2019; underwear,<br><br>So fantastic, no elastic,<br><br>Only tuppence a pair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;�until Feely flung a copy of Hymns Ancient and Modern at my head. One thing I have learned about organists is that they have absolutely no sense of humor.<br><br>&#x201c;Feely,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m freezing.&#x201d;<br><br>I shivered and buttoned up my cardigan. It was bitterly cold in the church at night. The choir had left an hour ago, and without their warm bodies round me, shoulder to shoulder like singing sardines, it seemed even colder still.<br><br>But Feely was submerged in Mendelssohn. I might as well have been talking to the moon.<br><br>Suddenly the organ gave out a fluttering gasp, as if it had choked on something, and the music gargled to a stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, fiddle,&#x201d; Feely said. It was as close to swearing as she ever came&#x2014;�at least in church. My sister was a pious fraud.<br><br>She stood up on the pedals and waddled her way off the organ bench, making a harsh mooing of bass notes.</p><h2>Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends</h2><p>In her first book, Middleton reveals the secrets to hosting a successful&nbsp;party with recipes, tips and detailed instructions on how to throw a memorable event.</p><p>Pippa Middleton is the editor of The Party Times, an online party magazine from Party Pieces, the UK&#39;s leading online party-supply company, founded in 1987.

While at a London hospital recuperating from a fall, Inspector Alan Grant becomes fascinated by a portrait of King Richard. A student of human faces, Grant cannot believe that the man in the picture would kill his own nephews.

The coffee table, which is stained and littered with ashtrays, empty bottles, and a tall blue bong, has been pushed against the far wall. The couch has been unfurled. It is a cheap couch, with no springs or gears or wooden endoskeleton; its cushions unfold flat onto the floor with a flat slapping sound: thwack. Also on the floor are several clear plastic bags containing dental dams, spermicidal lubricant, and latex gloves. There is everything, it seems to me, but an oxygen tank and a gurney.<br> <br>I am hunched in an awkward squat behind a woman on all fours, a woman who is blond and overweight.

To mark the occasion, I would like to shake the vagina&#x2019;s hand, talk to it for a while. How do you do, vagina? Would you like some herbal tea? But the vagina is businesslike and gruff. An impatient vagina, a waiting vagina.

The air in the room smells like a combination of a women&#x2019;s locker room and an off-track betting parlor, all smoke and sweat and scented lotions. My condom, the first I&#x2019;ve had occasion to wear in anything other than experimental conditions, pinches and dims sensation, so that my penis feels like what I imagine a phantom limb must feel like. The second woman has brown hair done up in curls, round hips, and dark, biscuit-wide nipples. She lies on the couch, waiting. As I proceed, foot by foot, struggling to keep my erection and my balance at the same time, her eyes coax me forward. She is touching herself.<br> <br>Now the target vagina is only a foot away. Now I feel like a military plane, preparing for in-air refueling. I feel, also, like a symbol. This is why I am here, ultimately. This is why, when the invitation was extended (&#x201c;Do you want to stay? I want you to stay&#x201d;), I accepted, and waited who knows how long in the dark room for them to return.

With its wild, bushy, thorny lashes, it winks. My heart flutters. My breathing quickens. I have been winked at by a vagina that looks like Andy Rooney.

As he entered the small caf�, he had no way of knowing how valuable the next few hours would be. </p><p> When he saw Ann Carr, he was surprised. He had heard she had been through some tough times herself and expected it to show on her. But she seemed upbeat and full of energy. </p><p> After some preliminary conversation, he said, "You look like you're in a good place, despite the bad times I understand you've been through." </p><p> She said, "I <i>am</i> in a good place, both in my work and in my life. But it's not in <i>spite</i> of the bad times. It's <i>because</i> of them -- and how I learned to take advantage of them." </p><p> Michael was puzzled. "How so?" he asked. </p><p> "Well, for example, at work I thought our department was doing fine, but in reality we weren't. We'd been successful, but we'd become complacent. By the time we realized it, other companies were doing much better than we were. My boss became very unhappy with me. </p><p> "That's when I started feeling low, and the pressure to improve things in a hurry began. Each day became more stressful." </p><p> Michael asked, "So, what happened?" </p><p> She answered, "I heard a story last year from someone at work I respected. It changed how I looked at good and bad times, and what I do now is very different. The story helped me to be calmer and more successful, whether things are going well or not, even in my personal life. I'll never forget it!" </p><p> "What was the story?" he asked. </p><p> Ann was quiet for a moment, and then said, "Would it be all right if I asked why you would like to know about it?" </p><p> Michael reluctantly admitted that he was not feeling very secure in his job, and things were not going so well for him at home. </p><p> He didn't need to say any more. She felt his embarrassment, and said, "You sound like you need to hear the story as much as I did." </p><p> Ann said she would tell Michael the story with the understanding that if he found it valuable, he would share it with others. He agreed, and Ann prepared Michael for what he was about to hear. </p><p> She said, "I found that if you want to use the story to deal with the ups and downs that come at you, it helps if you listen with your heart and head, and fill in the story with your own experience to see what is true for <i>you</i>. </p><p> "The insights in the story are often repeated, although in slightly different ways." </p><p> Michael asked "Why the repetition?" </p><p> She answered, "Well, for me, it made it easier to remember them. And when I remembered the insights, I used them more." </p><p> She admitted, "I'm reluctant to change. So, I need to hear something new often enough that, at some point, it gets past my critical, distrusting mind, becomes more familiar, and touches my heart. Then it becomes a part of me. </p><p> "That's what happened after I thought a lot about the story. But you can discover that for yourself, if you like." </p><p> "Do you really think a story can make that big a difference?" Michael asked. "I'm in a pretty tough spot right now." </p><p> Ann replied, "In that case, what do you have to lose? All I can tell you is that when I applied what I got out of the story, it had a big impact. </p><p> "Some people," she cautioned, "get very little from the story, while others get a great deal! </p><p> "It's not the story; it's what you take away from it that is so powerful. That's up to you, of course." </p><p> Michael nodded. "Okay. I think I would really like to hear it." </p><p> So Ann started to tell the tale over dinner, and then continued through dessert and coffee. </p><p> She began: Copyright � 2009 by Spencer Johnson, M.D.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b> 1<br> Feeling Low In A Valley </b> </p><p> Once there was a bright young man who lived unhappily in a valley, until he went to see an old man who lived on a peak. When he was younger, he had been happy in his valley. He played in its meadows and swam in its river. </p><p> The valley was all he had ever known, and he thought he would spend his whole life there. </p><p> Some days in his valley were cloudy and some were sunny, but there was a sameness to his daily routine that he found comforting. </p><p> However, as he grew older, he began to see what was wrong more often than he noticed what was right. He wondered why he had not noticed before how many things were wrong in the valley. </p><p> As time went on, the young man became increasingly unhappy, although he wasn't sure why. </p><p> He tried working at different jobs in the valley, but none turned out to be what he had hoped for. </p><p> In one job, his boss always seemed to criticize him for what he did wrong and never noticed all the things he did right. </p><p> In another, he was one of so many employees that it didn't seem to matter to anyone whether he worked hard or hardly worked at all. His contribution seemed invisible, even to himself. </p><p> Once, he thought he had finally found what he wanted. He felt appreciated and challenged, he worked with capable colleagues, and he was proud of the company's product. He worked his way up and became manager of a small department. </p><p> Unfortunately, he felt his job was not secure. </p><p> His personal life was no better. One disappointment seemed to follow another. </p><p> He thought his friends didn't understand, and his family told him he was "just going through a phase." </p><p> The young man wondered if he would be better off someplace else. </p><p> Sometimes the young man would stand in the meadow and look up at the range of majestic peaks that rose high above his valley. </p><p> He would imagine himself standing on the nearby peak. </p><p> For a while, he felt better. </p><p> But the more he compared the peak to his valley, the worse he felt. </p><p> He spoke to his parents and friends about going to the peak. But they talked only about how difficult it was to reach the peak, and how comfortable it was to stay in the valley. </p><p> They all discouraged him from going where they themselves had never been. </p><p> The young man loved his parents and knew there was some truth to what they said. But he also knew that he was a different person from his father and mother. </p><p> Sometimes he felt there might be a different way of life outside the valley, and he wanted to discover it for himself. Maybe on the peak he could gain a better view of the world. </p><p> But then doubt and fear crept in again, and he thought he would stay where he was. </p><p> For a long time the young man could not bring himself to leave his valley. </p><p> Then one day, he recalled his early youth and realized how much had changed since then. He was no longer at peace with himself. </p><p> He wasn't sure why he changed his mind, but he suddenly decided he had to go visit that mountaintop. </p><p> He put his fear aside and got ready to leave as quickly as he could. Then, he set out for the nearby peak. </p><p> It was not an easy journey. It took him much longer than he thought it would to make it less than halfway up the peak. </p><p> But as the young man went higher, the cool breeze and fresh air revitalized him. From higher up, his valley looked smaller. </p><p> When he had been down in the valley, the air seemed clean enough. But when he viewed the valley from above, he saw the pale brown stagnant air that was trapped there. </p><p> Then he turned and continued upward. The higher he climbed, the more he could see. </p><p> Suddenly, the trail he was following ended. </p><p> With no trail to follow, he became lost among the thick trees that blocked out the light. He feared he would not find his way out. </p><p> So, he decided to cross a dangerously narrow ridge. As he did, he fell. Bruised and bleeding, he picked himself up and continued on. </p><p> Eventually, he found a new path. </p><p> The warnings of the people in the valley crossed his mind. But then he gathered his courage and kept climbing. </p><p> The higher he went, the happier he became, knowing that he was leaving the valley and putting aside his fears. </p><p> He was on his way to someplace new. </p><p> As he rose above the clouds, he realized it was a beautiful day and imagined how the sunset would look from the summit. He could hardly wait to see it from up there.

The threat of the disease kept ships close to home and doomed those vessels that ventured too far from port. The willful ignorance of the royal medical elite, who endorsed ludicrous medical theories based on speculative research while ignoring the life-saving properties of citrus fruit, cost tens of thousands of lives and altered the course of many battles at sea. The cure for scurvy ranks among the greatest of human accomplishments, yet its impact on history has, until now, been largely ignored. <br><br>From the earliest recorded appearance of the disease in the sixteenth century, to the eighteenth century, where a man had only half a chance of surviving the scourge, to the early nineteenth century, when the British conquered scurvy and successfully blockaded the French and defeated Napoleon, <i>Scurvy </i>is a medical detective story for the ages, the fascinating true story of how James Lind (the surgeon), James Cook (the mariner), and Gilbert Blane (the gentleman) worked separately to eliminate the dreaded affliction. <br><br><i>Scurvy </i>is an evocative journey back to the era of wooden ships and sails, when the disease infiltrated every aspect of seafaring life: press gangs "recruit" mariners on the way home from a late night at the pub; a terrible voyage in search of riches ends with a hobbled fleet and half the crew heaved overboard; Cook majestically travels the South Seas but suffers an unimaginable fate. Brimming with tales of ships, sailors, and baffling bureaucracy, <i>Scurvy </i>is a rare mix of compelling history and classic adventure story.<br></p><p>Stephen R.

After over a year away, he wanted to celebrate his safe return. The merchant ship had returned to Portsmouth with a load of spices and exotic wood. It had been a good run; the winds and weather had been fair and the incidence of disease low. Still, he was lucky to have survived, and several of his fellow mariners had not. He had been ashore for several days, paid out by his captain, and he was enjoying his liberty, spending his hard-earned coin. Downing the last of many mugs of ale, he was surprised to find a shilling at the bottom. Something did not seem right, but he had had much to drink this night. Blessing his good fortune, he pocketed the coin, bade farewell to his drinking companions, and staggered from the crowded interior out onto the dark street, heading for a flophouse. He was followed from the alehouse. Three more men waited for him in the shadows. Armedwith clubs and with stern expressions on their faces, they surrounded him, leaving no room for escape. With dawning horror, the sailor realized his predicament. He felt the coin in his pocket, the King's Shilling, and belatedly knew that it had been placed in his drink, and that the men of the press gang would swear he had gladly taken it and agreed to join a ship's company. The men grabbed him and dragged him, protesting and struggling until a thump on his head silenced him, towards the harbour. A man-of-war had sailed into port and was looking for recruits.The sailor, like countless others, had now joined the Royal Navy. Life was so hard in the navy, the chance of death so high, and the demand for human fuel so insatiable during times of war that sailors in sufficient quantities to navigate the lumbering warships would rarely sign on voluntarily. It was far safer and more rewarding to sail on merchant ships. The navy's need for men was at least double, perhaps triple, the number of able-bodied seamen who willingly served. Ships were chronically short-handed. Offering a bonus to new recruits failed to provide the needed seamen. A quota system, whereby each county was responsible for furnishing to the navy a specified number of sailors, failed. Beseeching men to do their duty for their country also failed. Short of raising wages and improving conditions, the navy could guarantee a ready supply of sailors only by taking them by force.Famous fighting captains who were believed to have good luck, and who could boast of a good chance of prize money from capturing enemy ships, could announce their need for sailors on posters about town and receive a stream of able seamen eager to join the ship's company. But most captains had to resort to the notorious Impress Service. As a consequence, in eighteenth-century Britain men frequently disappeared from seaport towns and villages. Wandering alone one evening, they would be clubbed, dragged aboard a ship in port, and "recruited" into the navy. Wives were often left wondering what had become of their husbands, and children of theirfathers. Many were never seen by their families again. Press gangs patrolled the narrow warrens and alleys of the poor dockside quarters, searching for anyone alone or too drunk to flee, sailors preferably, but during wartime any reasonably able-bodied men would do. Sometimes the new recruits were rounded up by land-based agents of the Impress Service, who were paid a commission to deliver men to whichever ship lay in port. On other occasions, captains were empowered to search for men themselves, employing gangs usually consisting of four stout seamen armed with clubs and--officially, at least--one lieutenant armed with a cutlass, ostensibly used to impress bystanders with his martial appearance and social respectability. They would sally forth from the ship after darkness in pursuit of their quarry.Many of the "recruits" brought in by the press gangs had little or no experience at sea. Although officially the Impress Service had the legal right to deliver only "seamen, seafaring men and persons whose occupations or callings are to work in vessels and boats upon rivers," on short notice nearly anyone would do (providing they weren't influential or wealthy). Once shipboard, the men were subject to the law of the sea, and to leave was desertion. Desertion was punishable by death. The impressed sailor, if he was lucky, could look forward to years of harsh, brutal service at sea. If he was unlucky, he would die without ever setting foot on his native soil again. The naval historian Sir Harold Scott wryly observed that "it was a curious anomaly: the security of citizens depended on the Fleet. The manning of the Fleet was, therefore, a prime necessity, and the citizens--the pressed men among them, at least--were 'made slaves' in order to keep them free." Up to a third of a ship's company could be made up of men pressed from land or taken from incoming merchant ships.The majority of the men newly rounded up by the Impress Service, as might be supposed, were not the pick of the country; they were primarily spindle-legged landlubbers, vagrants, or tramps in the poorest of physical health. The press gang might also roust out the sick, malnourished, or elderly, or receive from local magistrates convicts who were given a choice between severe punishment or the king's service. Seamen aboard incoming merchant ships were also at risk of impressment. The Royal Navy stopped these ships and claimed any men on board, preferably those who had already served in the navy, beyond the absolute minimum needed to sail the vessel. But not all men in the navy were pressed or convicts. Many joined willingly: for a chance to see the world or out of patriotic duty. But some of those inclined to volunteer would do so only at the end of a particularly harsh winter, when a secure place to sleep, regular, if paltry, pay, and the promise of a daily meal overcame their fear of possible death and the inevitable loss of freedom.Once shipboard, duty was paramount. Discipline was strict, authoritarian, and often violent. There was a great social gulf between the commissioned officers and the common crew, and the captain was a virtual dictator while at sea. It was an age of severe punishments; life was cheap, and the concept of workers' rights lay in the distant future. Even minor crimes such as theft would be dealt with harshly, usually by flogging with the dreaded cat-o'-nine-tails. Crimes that seem relatively innocuous, such as disrespect for a superior officer or inattention to duty, were very serious shipboard, where the lives of all depended on each other; these could be punished with a dozen or even a hundred or more lashes--sometimes enough to kill a man. Because there were no standards for punishment, individual captains wielded great power over their crews. Some were known for being brutal martinets, lashing and beating sailors far in excess of their crimes, while others rarely resorted to the lash. Another common but lesser punishment was known as starting; an officer would whack a sailor with his cane if he thought he was moving too slowly or was showing belligerence to authority. Lashing and starting were most prevalent on ships with great numbers of convicts and pressed men, and they created a tense and gloomyatmosphere that was poor for morale and health. The threat of corporal punishment hung over every man's head.Most of the newly pressed recruits in the navy were not mariners and had never been to sea before. Although they all lived and slept together and ate the same food, there was a hierarchy even amongst the common sailors. While a contingent of skilled able seamen performed all the difficult tasks, such as climbing the rigging and setting the sails, the unskilled men, sickly or weak, were good only for hauling on a rope or swabbing the decks. Not only did they have no nautical skill or inclination, but many of the new recruits, and especially those who had recently come from prison, were already afflicted with one of the many illnesses common in the Age of Sail. Even the able seamen on the majority of ships were barely fit for the harsh realities of life at sea, and conditions became worse when the pressed sailors (morose and melancholy at their dreadful fate) and the convicts (delirious from typhus or dysentery) were taken on board and housed with the rest of the crew, thereby spreading discontent and disease throughout the ship's company.Mariners in the eighteenth century suffered from a bewildering array of ailments, diseases, and dietary deficiencies, such that it was next to impossible for surgeons or physicians to accurately separate the symptoms of one from those of another. Niacin deficiency caused lunacy and convulsions, thiamin deficiency caused beriberi, and vitamin-A deficiency caused night blindness. Syphilis, malaria, rickets, smallpox, tuberculosis, yellow fever, venereal diseases, dysentery, and food poisoning were constant companions. Typhus, or typhoid fever, was common on every ship. Spread by infected lice in the frequently shared and rarely cleaned bedding, typhus was so prevalent in the navy that it was known as "ship's fever" or "gaol fever." Man-of-war and merchantman, both were a cozy den for disease.Life shipboard was not conducive to curing or avoiding any of these varied ailments, and indeed was an ideal environment for spreading them. The sailor's wooden world was infested with refuse,trash, rotting flesh, urine, and vomit. The mariners were either crammed into their quarters like sardines in a box or slept, occasionally in good weather, sprawled like hounds on the deck. The holds were crammed with vermin, festering and spoiled provisions, and in some cases rotting corpses. On English and Dutch ships, the primarily Protestant dead sailors were wrapped in their hammocks and pitched overboard--with proper ceremony, naturally. But on the ships from Catholic countries such as France and Spain, the decaying bodies were stowed in the gravel of the hold, mouldering for perhaps months until the ships returned to home port and the dead could be buried in their native soil. The ships always leaked, and pumps could never keep the water our entirely, so the ballast of gravel or sand became incredibly putrid. Ventilation was poor and the bilge gases so noxious that it was extremely hazardous for carpenters to go below to work in the hold. The stench was unbearable, and occasionally men suffocated from inhaling the fumes.Sanitary conditions aboard ships, and particularly the warships of national navies, were as bad as or worse than the filthiest slums then in London, Amsterdam, Paris, or Seville. The cramped, stifling, congested forecastle, where the crew slept, was dark and dingy. The air was clouded with noxious bilge gasses and congested with the sweet, cloying reek of rot and sweat. Sailors slept in dirty bedding and wore the same vermin-infested rags for months on end. The British naval commander Frederick Chamier wrote in <i>The Life of a Sailor</i> of his first days on a ship in port as a young midshipman during the Napoleonic Wars. "Dirty women," he wrote, "the objects of sailors' affections, with beer cans in hand, were everywhere conspicuous: the shrill whistle squeaked, and the noise of the boatswain and his mate rattled like thunder in my ears; the deck was dirty, slippery and wet; the smells abominable; the whole sight disgusting."Overcrowding contributed to the unsanitary conditions and the spread of disease. The largest battleships, weighing approximately 2,500 tons and boasting 120 great guns, yet only several hundred feetlong, could house more than a thousand men. Large crews were needed because, in addition to manning the sails, eight to twelve men were required to operate each gun. Because of the high mortality rates, navy ships were oversupplied with men. The ships themselves were extremely valuable; they took years to build and required two thousand to three thousand mature oak trees each. It was unthinkable to lose a ship of the line because of a lack of manpower to sail it properly. Consequently, a warship requiring a normal complement of a thousand sailors would weigh anchor and depart for sea with many hundreds more crammed aboard. Perhaps five hundred men at any given time slung their hammocks between the great guns, in a compartment no more than 50 feet wide and 150 feet long. Sleeping, coughing, and sneezing with as little as fourteen inches between men encouraged the spread of infectious and contagious diseases. The overcrowding itself was as great a cause of disease as the unsanitary conditions. One of the great and sad ironies of the age was that naval authorities increased the number of men on ships in anticipation of replacing those who died. The overcrowding increased the deaths, however, leading naval authorities to strive for even greater numbers at the start of every voyage. It was a vicious circle that in the 1700s took a terrible toll of human life from all the major seafaring nations, leaving ships dangerously undermanned at sea and occasionally crippling entire fleets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A warship preparing for sea was a hive of chaotic activity. All hands scuttled about the dock and deck, hauling on rough hemp ropes and hoisting provisions and stores across the crack of water that separated the ship from the provisioning barge. They swabbed the upper deck, scrubbed the gun decks with vinegar, and fumigated the lower compartments with smoking brimstone to cleanse the malignant airs that were believed to be the cause of most ailments.They lowered the wrapped bundles and barrels into the gaping maw of the hatch, stowing everything in the dank bowels of the ship, including carpenters' tools, cutlasses and other weapons for close combat, kegs of gunpowder, mounds of cannonballs, spare spars, dozens of sails, vast coils of rope, tubs of tar, casks of grease, canisters of paint, cords of wood, and buckets of coral.But perhaps most impressive were the mountains of food needed to feed hundreds of mariners for months or years without replenishing. Although ships frequently purchased supplies from local ports, these could not be counted on for price or availability, and particularly in the navy, ships had to be prepared to carry out orders at a moment's notice. Once the provisions had been lowered onto the deck, the barefoot, pigtailed foremast jacks leapt to roll to the central hatch great oak barrels of salted beef, pork, and fish; kegs of English beer and West Indian rum; back-breaking burlap sacks of flour, dried peas, and oats; monstrous wheels of cheese; great blocks of butter; casks of molasses; and a huge quantity of hardtack cakes. The victualling yards of the major European ports were all well supplied to support departing ships on short notice.The standard naval diet varied only slightly over the centuries and only slightly between the various European nations. Ships' provisions were limited by what could be preserved or stored for months at a time without going bad. Salt beef or pork, dried peas or grains, or ship's biscuit were standard fare from the time of the Spanish Armada in the sixteenth century through the period when Dutch merchants piloted their way to Indonesia (the Dutch East Indies) to the era of the great naval battles between France and England in the eighteenth century. The Spanish fed on more oil and pickled vegetables, the Dutch on more sauerkraut and dunderfunk (fried biscuit with lard and molasses), but on the whole the sailors' diet was remarkably constant between nations--it simply reflected the only items that could survive for any length of tim...</p><h2>Gator A-Go-Go: A Novel (Serge Storms)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve never read Dorsey, you need to start.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<em>Miami Herald</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The world&#x2019;s biggest beach party is about to get crashed&#x2014;Serge A.

Gathering the work of more than 100 poets&#x2014;including many poems never previously anthologized and some published here for the first time&#x2014;it is the most comprehensive collection of its kind ever assembled, a celebration of the rich, varied, and often surprising beginnings of American poetry.<br><br>The range of voices is unprecedented: broadside and newspaper satires, epitaphs, children&#x2019;s verse, popular songs, ballads, and Christian hymns evoke the vital currency of poetry in daily life; exhortatory elegies for public figures and historical epics declaimed on occasions of state stand alongside intricate meditative lyrics and private epistolary verses. The dramatic unfolding of American history is made immediate and vivid in the words of the participants: William Bradford reflects on the growth of New England&#x2019;s first colonies; Roger Wolcott recounts the incidents of the Pequot War; Thomas Paine hails the victories of the American Revolution; Ann Eliza Bleecker describes her flight from General Burgoyne&#x2019;s invading army; loyalist Jonathan Odell bitterly mocks the new Continental Congress.<br><br>The first comprehensive anthology of early American poetry in more than a generation, this volume incorporates recent scholarly discoveries that have altered our understanding of the early American literary landscape.

The leader of this group is Stump, whose lost arm paid for Forever and Forever, and who believes the silent desperation that infuses the trailer park masks the fact that Forever and Forever is truly a small piece of hell on earth.<br> This ironic silence is shattered by the entrance of a beautiful young bombshell. Too Much is her name, and that is exactly what she is. This walking bonfire awakens long dead appetites in the inhabitants of Forever and Forever, reminding them of what they once were and can be again&#x2014;a<i>live.</i></p><p>Harry Crews&nbsp;is the author of twenty books and numerous articles and columns. He lives and works in Florida.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br>When Johnson Meechum came up the three steps of his purple double-wide trailer and opened the front door, his wife, Mabel, was waiting for him, her thin hands clenched on her hips, her tinted hair standing from her scalp in a tiny blue cloud. He could look right through the hair to her freckled skull.<br>He made a small adjustment of the .22-caliber target pistol stuck in the small of his back, behind his belt. He didn't even know why he wore it there. It was not as though she wasn't aware he took it with him when he went out in the morning. She knew everything about him. He knew everything about her. Everything. It was very nearly unbearable at times. He often wondered where all the surprises and lovely secrets had gone. He sometimes felt like he'd be willing to open a vein for one tiny surprise, for one inconsequential secret.<br>It was terrible to know the most excruciatingly intimate details about her person. He even knew the stink she left in the bathroom was inexplicably tinged with the fragrance of almonds. He had no idea why, but it was. And it had taken him the first two years of marriage to discover that she was capable of leaving a foul odor of any kind anywhere. Nothing stank during those first two years of marriage. Now, after sixty years together, everything stank. Even her age, which she wore like a moldy overcoat, stank of mortality. And he supposed he wore the same stinking overcoat, but if he did, he did everything to resist it, by keeping himself washed down in cologne. Mabel wore nothing, not even face powder. She either had no pride left or had just totally given up on everything.<br>Johnson didn't know, and he was ashamed to ask. But he could smell her fifteen feet away even if he had a bad head cold. That's why he had taken to sleeping on a blanket on the floor. He told her it was for his bad back, but it was really because of the ripe, almond-tainted effluvium that hovered everywhere about her and the sweat that she never seemed quite able to dig out of the creases and folds of her body. Consequently, she seemed to be covered with the coppery odor of impending death.<br>The thing that frightened Johnson the most was that he knew he must have his own odor of putrefaction, which no amount of cologne would ever cover. For years now, he had feared the stink of death worse than he had feared death itself. It kept him in a state of grinding humiliation and caused him to do inexplicable things like shoot the swamp every morning with his .22-caliber target pistol.<br>He went around her into the kitchen. She didn't seem to be blinking, or breathing either, for that matter. But she followed him into the kitchen and watched him silently draw a glass of water from the tap. She was close enough now -- right behind his left shoulder -- that he could hear and smell her ragged Camel breathing (only another odor she carried as though she had been born with it, and since she had been born with it, it was another stink she would be buried with). Johnson had quit smoking five years before, but he still thought he could smell a fine mist of tobacco on his skin.<br>He knew without turning to look that she still had her marble-size, arthritic knuckles planted firmly on her hips. She was about to tell him she had heard him outside. And he was going to respond by saying...well, he knew how he was going to respond.<br>"I heard you outside," she said.<br>"It doesn't matter," he said.<br>"Did anybody see you?"<br>"Nobody sees much of anything in Forever and Forever."<br>"That's not what I asked you."<br>"That's what I told you, though."<br>There was a silence now while they listened to the fake grandfather clock ticking above the stove. It was made in Taiwan. It sometimes seemed to Johnson that everything these days was made in Taiwan.<br>Mabel took her deformed fists off her hips and held her open hands in front of her, turning them first this way and then that, inspecting them as though they were something she thought she might buy.<br>"Do you remember when the sky was blue?" she said.<br>"Yes, I remember when the sky was blue," he said.<br>This was code talk they had between them. He couldn't remember how long they had talked of so many things in code. Code made conversation somehow less painful.<br>When she asked him if he remembered when the sky was blue, she was only asking if he remembered when they still loved each other. And, yes, he did. He did remember.<br>From far away, a siren started. It was coming this way.<br>"Another one," he said.<br>"Maybe not," she said. She was far more optimistic than he in these matters.<br>"It's another one," he said. "It's been a while. We're due for a turnover." That's what they called it when one of the residents of Forever and Forever passed. Nobody seemed to know how the phrase had started, but it sounded appropriate, at least to everybody but Mabel.<br>She frowned and said, "I'll not comment on that."<br>"Good," he said.<br>"Sometimes you say the meanest things," she said.<br>"All I said was 'Good,'" he said, but he knew what she meant.<br>They stood very still as the approaching siren came nearer. At the broad street under the arch reading FOREVER AND FOREVER, the siren shut down, and both Johnson and Mabel knew.<br>"I guess you were right," she said.<br>"I guess," he said, drawing another glass of water from the tap.<br>They saw the ambulance cruise past, the siren dead, the blinking lights off. No lights or sirens were allowed inside Forever and Forever. When the wagon came to pick up one of the residents, it had to come in quietly. It was an arrangement that Stump, the owner of Forever and Forever, had worked out with the company that had the hauling contract. Stump had many arrangements, and no lights or sirens on the ambulance once it was inside the trailer park was one of them. He never explained why.<br>He never explained much of anything. Why he called his place of business Forever and Forever was a puzzlement. But he never explained that either. He was not a man who seemed to care much about anything, particularly what people thought. Actually, what people thought of him and the way he did things seemed to be tight at the head of the list of things he cared least about.<br>When a problem was brought to him, he would look off toward the far horizon -- and all the horizons were far here in south Florida -- and say, "Me and my stump don't give much of a good goddam about that."<br>The stump he was talking about was what was left of his right arm, which stopped below the elbow, near the wrist, in a bright mangle of purple scar. There was much speculation about how he'd come to have the stump in the first place, but nobody had ever found out. And Stump had never been known to say a word about it. The few people who had been dumb enough to ask about it -- usually old parties who had recently moved into Forever and Forever -- had only got a blank stare that looked right through them. The look was such that they never asked again.<br>Nor did anybody ask about Stump's wife -- or at least everybody chose to think she was his wife, because that felt more seemly to the residents, and for the same reason they never privately or publicly commented on the fact that her name was Too Much. She said she was eighteen and might very well have been -- they were willing to give her that but she would have looked fourteen if she had not had...well, too much. Her titties were cantilevered at an impossible angle, and the unbelievable cheeks of her ass chewed constantly and voraciously at her cut-off Levi's, which were much too tight and much, much too short.<br>And she scratched. That's one of the things she did. Scratched. She never seemed to tire of it. And she not only never seemed to tire of it, she could stay longer and get deeper into the most intimate places than any of the old people could imagine. It shamed, angered, and outraged them. Consequently, they never stopped staring at her when she was outside by the pool or the shuffleboard courts or bending to water the flowers planted about the trailer park. She could bend and scratch at the same time and often did.<br>Mabel and Johnson, standing at the sink, turned to watch the ambulance slide silently past in the street.<br>"Who do you think?" asked Mabel.<br>"I don't know that it matters."<br>"It's a wonder to me," said Mabel, "that ambulances don't get lost in this place. I've been in towns smaller than Forever and Forever. How they find whoever they're looking for or don't get lost and can't find their way out has always been a mystery to me. Especially way on the back side, where the streets are as crooked as a dog's hind leg."<br>"Oh, it's happened," said Johnson. "Was a time when it happened a lot, but I understand the company that's got the hauling rights came in here and made their own map, numbering the trailers, so that they could find who they were looking for. I'd bet the shoes I'm standing in that nobody living in this place has ever been on every street in it."<br>"Oh, I think Stump probably has."<br>"Stump is the last one that would have walked all the streets of the park he owns. He only wants a quiet, uncomplicated place for himself to live and a quiet, uncomplicated place for the rest of us to die."<br>"That was an unfortunate thing to say, Johnson, very unfortunate. You've gone off your game. If you'd quit shooting that swamp every morning, things might improve for you and for me. You know people are starting to talk, don't you?"<br>"I'm just like Stump -- I don't give a lot of thought to what people say."<br>"Stump's got one up on you, old man. At least he owns Forever and Forever, which has got to be bigger than some farms I've seen."<br>"I've got both arms, though. It all evens out."<br>"He may not have but one arm, but he's got Too Much."<br>"Too Much is exactly what he's got, truth be known."<br>"What would you know about the truth? Shooting a swamp like you do every morning. Shooting swamps is not normal. They lock people away for doing stuff like that."<br>"No. People get locked away for walking out the front door naked because they forgot to put their clothes on. That's the kind of thing that will get you locked up. As long as you can get to the grocery, cook, wash your clothes, and make sure to wear them when you go out, nobody's going to mess with you. And shooting the swamp? That's nothing, absolutely nothing. And someday I'll give that son of a bitch the coup de gr�ce. See if I don't."<br>"See, that right there is crazy."<br>"Wrong again. That's just eccentric."<br>Mabel put her hands back on her hips and said, "It's sometimes I get so tired of the way you talk, I could put a hatchet in your head."<br>"Ditto," said Johnson.<br>She came to stand closer at his shoulder. The sky was blazingly hot and blindingly brilliant, but they stared at it through the window anyway, their eyes squinted.<br>"Do you remember when the sky was always blue?"<br>"Yes," he said, "I do." He drew another glass of water and drank it off. "But things change; even the fucking sky changes. That's the long and the short of it."<br>"Do you remember when we started cussing so much? Seems like it was a time we hardly cussed at all."<br>He regarded the empty glass in his hand for a long moment. "No," he said. "I don't remember when we started getting so bad about cussing, but I think it had something to do with moving into Forever and Forever."<br>"Probably. But you've got to admit Forever and Forever's centrally located."<br>"I don't have to admit <i>anything."</i><br>"There wasn't anyplace else for us to go."<br>"All right. I know that if I don't know anything else. Does that make you happy?"<br>He didn't wait for an answer but drank another glass of tepid water, which he was convinced was good for his bowels. His favorite joke, which he was sure he had heard somewhere and had not made up himself, though he could not be positive about it (there was so little left in his world he could be positive about), was this: I've reached that stage in life where a good defecation is better than a good fornication. It was a bitter joke, though, because it had come to be the truth.<br>He filled a glass and offered it to Mabel. "Why don't you drink a glass of this?"<br>She regarded the glass, and when she spoke, she kept her eyes on it. "My stool is as soft as a baby's. I'll let you see it the next time I go."<br>"I'll take your word for it," he said, and he poured the water back into the sink.<br>As he watched the water swirl down the drain, he wondered when they had first started talking about the consistency of each other's stools before breakfast. It so angered and baffled him that he thought about going out and shooting the swamp again. But it was too late in the morning, and Stump had already warned him twice about shooting his swamp, though Johnson didn't think Stump meant it. After all, what harm could it do? It didn't, for that matter, even make any sense, and unfortunately Johnson knew that too.<br><br>Copyright � 1998 by Harry Crews</p><h2>Peanuts Classics</h2><p>Contains a clipping of comics pages from Times Herald of Port Huron, Michigan, announcing under the date of 2-13-00 Schultz&#39;s retirement.</p><p></p><h2>InterWorld</h2><p><p>When Newbery Medal winner Neil Gaiman and Emmy Award winner Michael Reaves teamed up, they created the bestselling YA novel <em>InterWorld</em>.<br>&nbsp;<br><em>InterWorld</em> tells the story of Joey Harker, a very average kid who discovers that his world is only one of a trillion alternate earths.

Based on the size and shape of my nose, the captain believed I lacked sufficient energy and determination to endure the arduous sea voyage he planned to make round the world.<p></p><b> </b>How did it come about that Captain FitzRoy, a perfect stranger, should care so deeply about my nose? And what was his decision and the results of it? To answer those questions and others that may arise, let me begin at the beginning, long before I ever heard of the captain or of his ship HMS <i>Beagle. </i><p></p> *****<p></p> I was born February 12th, 1809, in the town of Shrewsbury, county of Shropshire, England, and christened Charles Robert Darwin. For the first few years of my life my family called me Bobby. My father, Dr. Robert Darwin, practised medicine. My brother Erasmus, called Ras, older by four years and two months, our four sisters, our parents, and I lived at The Mount, a great brick mansion built high on a hill above the River Severn with a view of Shrewsbury Castle&#x2019;s ancient red sandstone walls.<p></p><b> </b>Facts are unchanging, but memories are mutable&#x2014;sometimes sharp, sometimes out of focus, sometimes shadowy or absent altogether. From the early years of my childhood I can summon only a few blurred images. I offer this brief list:<p></p><b> </b>Paddling in the sea on the north coast of Wales with my younger sister, Catty.<p></p><b> </b>Gathering beetles and shells and pebbles and various plants for my collection, my older sister Caroline complaining of the odour.<p></p><b> </b>Sitting on the riverbank with Ras whilst he patiently taught me how to spit a worm on a fishhook and answered my endless questions; I idolised him.<p></p><b> </b>Walking with my mother to the small day school taught by the Reverend Case and being frightened by a dog barking in the street.<p></p><b> </b>Standing uneasily by my mother&#x2019;s sickbed as she whispered something to me, and being brought to that same room days later to see her laid out on the bed in a black velvet gown, my brother and sisters weeping inconsolably and my father&#x2019;s face contorted with grief. I, too, wept, but without realising all that I wept for. Oddly enough, I remember nothing about her funeral. Mostly I remember her absence.<p></p><b> </b>I was eight and a half years old and no longer called Bobby. I was now Charles, and sometimes Charley.<p></p><b> </b>The images become etched more clearly when I reached the age of nine. At the beginning of the summer quarter my father enrolled me at Shrewsbury School, across the road from the old castle and less than a mile from The Mount. I could have continued living at home whilst attending classes, but Father thought it best if I boarded at the school.<p></p><b> </b>"Your mother and I made this decision some time ago," he said sternly when I begged to stay at home with Catty and continue my schooling with Caroline as my teacher. "We both felt that you would pay more attention to your studies there."<p></p><b> </b>And so off I went, desperately unhappy but trying to be brave.<p></p><b> </b>Ras had been toiling away at the school for four years when I arrived. He may have rather enjoyed it at the outset, being away from our sisters and not having to endure lessons with them any longer. He pointed out that all of our boy cousins had been sent away to boarding school. Only girls got to stay at home. "Believe me, Charley, it&#x2019;s better than being all day with the sisterhood"&#x2014;his name for our sisters.<p></p><b> </b>But he had serious complaints about the school.<p></p><b> </b>"Eat up whilst you can, Charley," advised Ras, a tall, thin, rather frail lad who looked as though he ought to take his own advice. "You&#x2019;ll get little enough to put in your stomach, and what you do get isn&#x2019;t fit for a dog. There&#x2019;s a sign by the headmaster&#x2019;s gateway with his initials, SB, on it. The letters stand for &#x2018;Stale Bread, Sour Beer, Salt Butter, Stinking Beef&#x2014;for Sale By Samuel Butler.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s the headmaster&#x2019;s name. And try to smuggle in an extra blanket. You could read your Latin grammar through the nap of the thin shroud you&#x2019;ll be issued. No use having Father go to Dr. Butler for it. He refuses all such requests."<p></p><b> </b>Maurice, the groom, drove me to school on my first day, informed one of the masters of my arrival, carried my trunk up to my bed, and left me there with a handshake and a pat on the shoulder. "Ye&#x2019;ll be all right now, Master Charley," he said, and hurried away. I struggled not to cry or behave in an infantile manner, though I longed to run after him and plead to be taken home.<p></p><b> </b>Then I met Garnett, the boy with whom I would be forced to share a bed. I told him my name. Garnett had looked me over cannily. "Like to fight?" he&#x2019;d asked, and I said that I&#x2019;d never been in a fight in my life and was sure I would not like it. He smirked. "I&#x2019;d have thought by the look of that nose of yours you&#x2019;d already taken a few jabs. You&#x2019;re thick as a stump, Darwin, and you look strong enough," he said. "We could make a good fighter out of you, if you&#x2019;d a mind."<p></p><b> </b>Self-consciously I covered my nose with my hand. "But there&#x2019;s nothing to fight about," I said, hoping I was right but already guessing I might be wrong.<p></p><b> </b>It did not take long for me to learn to loathe the school. It took a little longer to plan my escapes.<p></p><b> </b>At the end of each day the boys lined up stiffly in the school refectory for the calling-over. One of the masters read out our names, starting with the oldest students, the sixth formers, who were then dismissed, and ending with the youngest. I&#x2019;d been placed in the lower third form.<p></p><b> </b>"Darwin!"<p></p><b> </b>"Here, sir!"<p></p><b> </b>Once my name had been called and the lower third dismissed, I contrived to slip away by the servants&#x2019; side door and bolted across the wet lawn and through the unlocked iron gates to freedom. I prided myself on being a fast runner and hadn&#x2019;t far to go&#x2014;ten minutes if I gave it my best, trotting along the old town walls, across the Severn by the Welsh Bridge, and up the hill to The Mount. Spark, our black-and-white pup, was first to greet me. At the sound of his joyous barking Marianne, twenty years old and the eldest of my sisters, set down the needlepoint canvas she was working. Caroline, sixteen, laid aside the book she&#x2019;d been reading aloud&#x2014;one of Miss Jane Austen&#x2019;s novels during that autumn of 1818&#x2014;and gasped, "Charley! What on earth&#x2014;?"<p></p><b> </b>Susan, the fifteen-year-old sister I sometimes called Granny, frowned her disapproval. "Charley, you ought not be here!" she scolded. "You&#x2019;re breaking the rules, and you&#x2019;ll get caught and punished, and Papa will be furious."<p></p><b> </b>During our mother&#x2019;s lingering illness Caroline had made herself into a kind of substitute mother for me and Catty, younger by a year. Caroline was tall and serious as a judge, thick black hair pulled into heavy plaits, and she had sat with us every day at a low table in a corner of the nursery at the top of the house. She&#x2019;d taught us our letters and numbers, supervised the practise of penmanship, and patiently rehearsed us in our Bible verses and the prayers we were expected to recite faultlessly when she took us each by the hand and led us off to worship at St. Chad&#x2019;s. This church was the only building I had ever been inside that was not square but round, and for that reason alone I found it interesting. We&#x2019;d all been christened there. Father, not a churchgoing man, didn&#x2019;t accompany us on Sunday mornings.<p></p><b> </b>I was a pensive boy often lost in my own thoughts, and that dreaminess exasperated my sisters. "Charley is clearly bright enough," I&#x2019;d once heard Caroline remark to Susan, who replied, "Yes, but he is intolerably lazy." Catty was quicker than I was, though not much more interested in her studies. She preferred to amuse herself with dressing her dolls and feeding them flower petals from Father&#x2019;s conservatory. Ras, we all knew, was the brilliant one.<p></p><b> </b>Now, as I appeared unexpectedly after my escape, Catty threw down the speller Caroline had assigned her and flung her arms round me. "Charley! I&#x2019;m so glad to see you! Is the school truly horrid? Do you hate it? Oh, I do wish you were still at home with us!"<p></p><b> </b>"It doesn&#x2019;t matter if he hates it," Susan said severely, glowering at me over her spectacles. That&#x2019;s why I called her Granny.<p></p><b> </b>The school was every bit as dreadful as Ras had promised, but I put on a brave face and squirmed out of Catty&#x2019;s embrace. "I wish I were still here, too," I admitted.<p></p><b> </b>I&#x2019;d loved rambling round The Mount in all kinds of weather, sometimes letting Catty ramble with me, on foot or on our ponies. We&#x2019;d spent hours together by the river, perched in the crooked branches of the old Spanish chestnut tree I&#x2019;d named Borum, sending messages to each other by means of ropes and pulleys in the code I devised. The tree where an owl nested I called Owlo, and I&#x2019;d invented names for members of the household: Nancy, our nursemaid, was "Pea-spitter," and Father was dubbed "Squirt." I don&#x2019;t know how I came upon those names, but I do know that Father, for one, would not have been amused. Now there was no opportunity for rambling or for perching in trees, and I missed this world with an ache felt in my bones.<p></p><b> </b>"I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re too early for tea," Marianne said, placidly threading a needle with a length of rose-coloured wool. "You know we always wait for Papa."<p></p><b> </b>"I know." Father seldom got home from his evening medical calls before eight o&#x2019;clock, and by that hour I had to be back at the school and in my dormitory or suffer dire consequences. If Father had found me at home, the consequences would have been dire as well.<p></p><b> </b>Nancy rushed in, clucking her tongue, and rushed out again. "Lad&#x2019;s like to starve to death," she muttered when she&#x2019;d returned with a plate of teacakes, and I&#x2019;d gobbled up two and stuffed two more in my trouser pockets.<p></p><b> </b>There was not much time between calling-over and locking up at Shrewsbury School&#x2014;no more than an hour&#x2014;and though I stretched my visit home to the last possible moment, I knew I would have to run fast to reach the school before I was shut out. A glance at the gold clock on the drawing room mantel warned me that the time had come to wrench myself away. I was bestowing one last belly rub on Spark when I heard the crunch of Father&#x2019;s carriage on the gravel drive leading to the front entrance. Caroline hurried me to the back door. "Dear Charley," she murmured. "Be off with you now, and quickly!"<p></p><b> </b>I began to run, my feet skidding down the path to the river. I could picture the scene I left behind in every detail:<p></p><b> </b><i>Father heaves himself out of the smart yellow phaeton recognised by everyone in Shropshire and hands the reins to the groom. He is a large man&#x2014;immense, in fact. Well over six feet tall, he&#x2019;d stopped weighing himself some years earlier, when he reached twenty-four stone, exceeding three hundred pounds. His bulk fills the doorway. My sisters rise to greet him, smoothing their skirts, offering smiles.<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"Good evening, my dears," he says. His voice is surprisingly high and light for a man of such size. A stranger might have expected a low growl. He allows each daughter to kiss his cheek.<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"Good evening, Papa," says Marianne. She pronounces it Pa-</i>pa; <i>to say </i>Pa<i>-pa or </i>Mam<i>-ma, with the accent switched back to front, is what people of the lower classes call their parents, not well-bred young ladies like the Darwin girls.<p></p></i><b> </b><i>And so it goes, down the line in order of age, the kiss planted on his smooth cheek, the greeting, the smile for Pa-</i>pa<i>. Last comes Catty, his pet and well aware of her special place as the youngest.<p></p></i><b> </b>On I ran, panting, ignoring a little pebble in my shoe, too worried about coming late to stop and fix it. The Severn wrapped round Shrewsbury as though tying a parcel. Fog curled up from the river and clung to my skin like silk.<p></p><b> </b><i>Father settles into his favourite chair, built specially for him with adequate reinforcement and covered in deep red plush velvet. The manservant kneels to remove his boots and presents his slippers, warmed and ready. Marianne rings the bell, calling the parlour maid to bring the tea. It is Caroline&#x2019;s honour to pour from an elegant teapot into five delicate cups. The teapot, cups, saucers, and cake plates are all from the Wedgwood Potteries, owned by my uncle Jos. We all remember they were Mamma&#x2019;s particular favourites.<p></p></i><b> </b>I pounded across the Welsh Bridge and plunged, panting, through the dark, narrow streets and over the worn cobblestones of the town centre. Shrewsbury School loomed ahead, a bleak grey stone presence. Fear drove me. I&#x2019;d shaved it a bit too close, lingered at home a bit too long. Suppose I found the iron gate barred, the door locked and bolted? Darkness had closed in, the fog thickened to a drizzle.<p></p><b> </b>Determination turned to desperation as the hour hand of the clock in the tower of Old Market Hall moved tick by tick towards my doom. I&#x2019;d be flogged and ordered into the Black Hole Garnett had told me about, left in the cold blackness of the narrow cell for hours, perhaps even forgotten for days, as he swore had happened to others. Expulsion and the horrified embarrassment of my father would surely follow. The thought filled me with dread. I kept a little prayer ready for when disaster loomed: <i>Heavenly Father, I most humbly pray to Thee&#x2014;help me run faster!<p></p></i><b> </b>My prayer was answered. In the very nick of time I reached the servants&#x2019; entrance and found the gate and the door still miraculously open. In the distance the clock began to strike. Seeing no sign of Old Philip, the verger in charge of locking up, I scrambled undetected up the dark stair to the fetid attic that smelt of urine. Some two dozen unwashed boys slept two to a bed on seldom-laundered sheets. There was only one window with a row of washstands lined up beneath it. I fell, wheezing, onto the bed I shared with Garnett.<p></p><b> </b>A year and a half older and far more knowing than I in the ways of the world and Shrewsbury School, Garnett was waiting for me, eyes gleaming with malice. "What&#x2019;ve you brought me, Darwin?" he demanded. Garnett knew about my little escapes&#x2014;this had not been my first&#x2014;and threatened to report me if I failed to buy him off. I fumbled in my trouser pockets and produced the mashed and crumbled remains of the teacakes.<p></p><b> </b>Garnett&#x2019;s lip curled in disgust. "You&#x2019;ve got to do better than this," he said. "Next time, pray, bring a meat pie&#x2014;if you know what&#x2019;s good for you."<p></p><b> </b>I nodded, and Garnett bolted down the scorned teacakes, crumbs falling on our shared blanket.

Attend a championship grave-digging competition, or, should you feel you've wasted yet another day, you can check in for help at a local Misspent Youth Center.<br><br>In "The Beauty Supply District," a new twenty-four-page story, Knipl attends an evening concert and unwittingly enters the world of wholesale empathizers and chiaroscuro brokers who make the decisions critical to the production of aesthetic pleasure in all its forms -- from the shape of an olive jar to the score of a string quartet.</p><p>Typical of Ben Katchor's recursive, compact style, <i>The Beauty Supply District</i> is actually the title of three distinct entities: this collection of over 80 installments of his 8-panel comic strip "Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer" (appearing in <i>The Forward</i> and other weekly papers); a new, 24-page story with which Katchor concludes; and the subject of that final story, a commercial district on the edge of Julius Knipl's imaginary, melancholy Gotham. In the beauty supply district, the city's aesthetic needs are catered to by businesses like Synthetic A Priori Corp., Surface Meaning Refinishers Inc., and the Senseless Elaboration Parlor.<p> That might be a lot to digest for anyone new to Knipl's wistful, chiaroscuro world (the first two collections of this strip, <i>Stories</i> and <i>Cheap Novelties</i>, might prove more accessible). But <i>Beauty Supply District</i> captures Katchor's strip at the height of its form--from semi-professional gravediggers competing at the Cemetery of the Expired Coupon Redeemer to the chance discovery (at a drug store, naturally) of how production of cheap writing instruments has far outstripped the demands of poetic inspiration.</p><p> <i>New York Times Review of Books</i> critic Edward Sorel called <i>Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer</i> "perhaps the most original comic strip since ... 'Krazy Kat' more than 80 years ago."

He accomplished this by looking up over the top of the morning paper and saying some of the most frightening words in the English language: "I'd like for you to meet my mother."<br><br>For a minute I hoped he was reading a "Dear Abby" letter out loud, but no such luck.<br><br>"What?" I said, not so much because I hadn't heard him, but as a stalling tactic.<br><br>"I said I'd like for you to meet my mother. Do you have plans for Thanksgiving? Maybe you could ride up to Bakersfield with me and join our family gathering."<br><br>"I don't know. I'll have to check with Barbara. She may be counting on me showing up at her place."<br><br>He put down the paper and made a who-are-you-trying-to-kid face at me, and said, "You'd rather spend Thanksgiving with Kenny?"<br><br>He had me there. "Well, no, I wouldn't." Barbara is my older sister, recently reunited with her ex-husband, Kenny O'Connor. Kenny's dad and I had been the best of friends, even after my sister and Kenny had their messy divorce. His dad, affectionately known simply by his last name, O'Connor, had been my mentor and confidante at the Las Piernas News Express, the newspaper I work for. But O'Connor had been murdered that last summer, and in the aftermath of that event, Kenny and Barbara got back together.<br><br>O'Connor's death also led to my being reunited with an old acquaintance, the man who sat across the breakfast table from me. Frank Harriman is a homicide detective with the Las Piernas Police Department. Neither of our employers were too nutty over the idea of a cop and a reporter getting together, but we decided we could survive a little criticism, given some of the other things we had survived that summer.<br><br>Initially, I had been afraid that our relationship was just a reaction to all of the violence of that time. But those fears had proved unfounded over the last few months.<br><br>Fear of thy lover's mother is another thing altogether.<br><br>For some women, this would probably have been a moment of victory. They would read it as kind of promotion, a step up the prenuptial ladder. I remembered when Alicia Penderson, an old rival of mine, ran around bragging that her premed boyfriend was taking her home to meet the family over Christmas. She had started pricing rings the next day. She wanted, as they say, "a rock." Gibraltar wasn't available or she would have had a setting made for it.<br><br>But I have never been much like the Alicia Pendersons of this world, and so I anticipated meeting Frank's mother with much the same enthusiasm as a mallard awaits the opening day of duck-hunting season.<br><br>Out of the bag of assorted misgivings I had about being introduced to her, I pulled my question to Frank that morning.<br><br>"Why do you want me to meet your mother?"<br><br>"Don't you want to meet her?"<br><br>"Of course I do," I said. Some might say I lied when I said that, but what I meant was, someday I wanted to know his mother, and have the meeting part all over and done with.<br><br>He had put the paper aside now and was studying me. Frank is unfortunately very good at this, and I can seldom hide my feelings from him. Those gray-green eyes were alive with amusement now.<br><br>"She'll like you," he said, once again proving his knack for getting to the core of things. I suppose it's a good skill to have in his line of work.<br><br>"How do you know she'll like me?"<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"Frank, I am so comforted by that."<br><br>"Too early to be snide, Irene."<br><br>"Too early to think about meeting your mother. You're right, I'm afraid she won't like me."<br><br>"I like you. She'll like you when she sees how much I like you."<br><br>"For a cop, you have a very optimistic outlook on life."<br><br>He shook his head. "I thought you'd be happy about it."<br><br>"It's nice for you to invite me. I'm flattered. But for starters, why don't you see if your mom wants another mouth to feed on Thanksgiving? She may just want to be with her family."<br><br>"She won't mind," he said. More optimism.<br><br>He stood up, taking the breakfast dishes with him. Concerned that I had insulted him with my lack of enthusiasm, I got up from the table and went over to him as he reached the sink. I stood behind him and wrapped my arms around him. He's so tall, this put my head somewhere between his shoulder blades. He set the breakfast dishes in the sink and turned around to face me.<br><br>"You worry about the damnedest things, Irene. But I'll call and ask her today. Want to get together for dinner?"<br><br>"Sure, but it's Halloween. Do you get many kids trick-or-treating over here?" Frank lives near the beach, and I hadn't seen many young families in his neighborhood.<br><br>"No, not really -- just two or three families with kids on this block. I'm not often home from work in time to give them anything, so Mrs. Fremont usually hands out treats for me." Mrs. Fremont, his next-door neighbor, was about eighty years old. She had lived in that house for most of those years. Mr. Fremont had gone to his reward long ago, and while she still talked with fondness about their marriage, she seemed quite content with her life alone. She lived simply, but was actually very well-to-do. The ocean air must have been good for her, because you would never have guessed her to be over sixty. She was a real live wire.<br><br>"How about coming over to my place after you get off work?" I asked. "I don't have a Mrs. Fremont, so I'll be on candy-duty."<br><br>"Okay. I'll take you out for a late dinner."<br><br>"You've got a deal." I looked at my watch. "You're going to be late, Frank. Want me to take the stuff over to Mrs. Fremont for you?"<br><br>"That would be great." He walked over to the freezer and pulled out a bag of miniature Snickers.<br><br>"Frozen?" I asked.<br><br>"It's the only way I can keep myself from powering down a bag of them myself. It's been driving me nuts just knowing they're in the house. They'll thaw by tonight."<br><br>"Why, Frank Harriman, I never would have thought of you as a man with a sweet tooth."<br><br>He leaned over and kissed me good-bye, saying, "I don't know why not," and scrambled out the door.<br><br>Thinking about my own need to get to work, I made sure his house was locked up and then gathered my purse and overnight bag. Nabbing the cold bag of Snickers as well, I fumbled my way out of the house, then set the deadbolt. Frank had let me park my old '71 ragtop Karmann Ghia in the driveway the night before, and as I was stuffing my overnight bag into the trunk, I saw Mrs. Fremont returning from her morning jog.<br>0 <br><br>"Good morning, Irene!" she called. "When are you going to come running with me again?"<br><br>I smiled at her, remembering my surprise the first time I heard this proposal. We had gone running together several times since, and I found I didn't have to make concessions to her pace. "Soon, I hope. I haven't been able to do much running this week."<br><br>"All that election coverage," she said knowingly. She spied the bag of Snickers clenched in my right hand. Her bright blue eyes sparkled. "Did Frank leave those for me to hand out tonight?"<br><br>"Yes, I was going to come over with them as soon as I got my overnight bag put away." For some reason, I felt myself blush.<br><br>She laughed. "My dear, I hope you don't worry about my judging your relationship with Frank. You've been very good for him. Couldn't stand the last one -- that was years ago. It's about time that man had a woman in his life again. And as for your spending the night with him -- don't forget, I was a teenager at the height of the Roaring Twenties. We could teach you kids a thing or two."<br><br>When you're pushing forty, it's always nice to be called a kid.<br><br>"Well, Mrs. Fremont, I'm sure you could," I said, handing the bag of candy over to her. "And I know you don't judge me. I guess I'm fretting over an idea Frank has -- he wants me to meet his mother at the family Thanksgiving dinner."<br><br>"Oh, and you're afraid if his mother doesn't like you, that will be that?"<br><br>I thought about her question. "I guess so. That, and the fact that I'm not sure what Frank means by bringing me home to his mother."<br><br>She gave me a kind look. "Well, Irene, you know I'm not into this role of being some old lady who imparts her wisdom to the younger generations at the drop of a hat. But let me ask you this -- do you and Frank love each other?"<br><br>I turned crimson, but answered, "Yes."<br><br>"Well then, don't worry about what Frank means by this invitation. Enjoy Thanksgiving -- you've got everything you need in life, with or without his mother's approval. Frank is no fool, Irene."<br><br>"Thanks, Mrs. Fremont."<br><br>"Go on to work. I've got to get going myself -- I've got to carve a jack-o-lantern. Happy Halloween!"<br><br>"Same to you," I said, getting into the car and waving as I drove off. As I made my way down the streets of Las Piernas, I was already turning my thoughts to being with Frank again. I was looking forward to sharing a pleasant evening together.<br><br>I was being optimistic.<br><br>As it turned out, that Halloween, someone was up to some very cruel tricks indeed.<br><br>Copyright � 1994 by Jan Burke</p><h2>EYE OF NEEDLE</h2><p>As the Allied armies prepare for D-Day, &#34;Der Nadel,&#34; Hitler&#39;s handpicked agent, attempts to escape London with the secret that will bring the Allies down</p><p>Ken Follett is the author of numerous international bestsellers, including Jackdaws, Hornet Flight, Code to Zero, Triple, Eye of the Needle, Pillars of the Earth, and A Dangerous Fortune.

Reconnaissance planes brought back photographs of barracks and airfields and fleets of ships in the Wash; General George S. Patton was seen in his unmistakable pink jodhpurs walking his white bulldog; there were bursts of wireless activity, signals between regiments in the area; confirming signs were reported by German spies in Britain.</p><p>There was no army, of course. The ships were rubber-and-timber fakes, the barracks no more real than a movie set; Patton did not have a single man under his command; the radio signals were meaningless; the spies were double agents.</p><p>The object was to fool the enemy into preparing for an invasion via the Pas de Calais, so that on D-Day the Normandy assault would have the advantage of surprise.</p><p>It was a huge, near-impossible deception. Literally thousands of people were involved in perpetrating the trick. It would have been a miracle if none of Hitler&#x2019;s spies ever got to know about it.</p><p>Were there any spies? At the time people thought they were surrounded by what were then called Fifth Columnists. After the war a myth grew up that MI5 had rounded up the lot by Christmas 1939. The truth seems to be that there were very few; MI5 did capture nearly all of them.</p><p>But it only needs one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>It is known that the Germans saw the signs they were meant to see in East Anglia. It is also known that they suspected a trick, and that they tried very hard to discover the truth.</p><p>That much is history. What follows is fiction.</p><p>Still and all, one suspects something like this must have happened.</p><p><i>Camberley, Surrey, June 1977</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>IT was the coldest winter for forty-five years. Villages in the English countryside were cut off by the snow and the Thames froze over. One day in January the Glasgow-London train arrived at Euston twenty-four hours late. The snow and the blackout combined to make motoring perilous; road accidents doubled, and people told jokes about how it was more risky to drive an Austin Seven along Piccadilly at night than to take a tank across the Siegfried Line.</p><p>Then, when the spring came, it was glorious. Barrage balloons floated majestically in bright blue skies, and soldiers on leave flirted with girls in sleeveless dresses on the streets of London.</p><p>The city did not look much like the capital of a nation at war. There were signs, of course; and Henry Faber, cycling from Waterloo Station toward Highgate, noted them: piles of sandbags outside important public buildings, Anderson shelters in suburban gardens, propaganda posters about evacuation and Air Raid Precautions. Faber watched such things&#x2014;he was considerably more observant than the average railway clerk. He saw crowds of children in the parks, and concluded that evacuation had been a failure. He marked the number of motorcars on the road, despite petrol rationing; and he read about the new models announced by the motor manufacturers. He knew the significance of night-shift workers pouring into factories where, only months previously, there had been hardly enough work for the day shift. Most of all, he monitored the movement of troops around Britain&#x2019;s railway network; all the paperwork passed through his office. One could learn a lot from that paperwork. Today, for example, he had rubber-stamped a batch of forms that led him to believe that a new Expeditionary Force was being gathered. He was fairly sure that it would have a complement of about 100,000 men, and that it was for Finland.</p><p>There were signs, yes; but there was something jokey about it all. Radio shows satirized the red tape of wartime regulations, there was community singing in the air raid shelters, and fashionable women carried their gas masks in couturier-designed containers. They talked about the Boer War. It was at once larger-than-life and trivial, like a moving picture show. All the air raid warnings, without exception, had been false alarms.</p><p>Faber had a different point of view&#x2014;but then, he was a different kind of person.</p><p>He steered his cycle into Archway Road and leaned forward a little to take the uphill slope, his long legs pumping as tirelessly as the pistons of a railway engine. He was very fit for his age, which was thirty-nine, although he lied about it; he lied about most things, as a safety precaution.</p><p>He began to perspire as he climbed the hill into Highgate. The building in which he lived was one of the highest in London, which was why he chose to live there. It was a Victorian brick house at one end of a terrace of six. The houses were high, narrow and dark, like the minds of the men for whom they had been built. Each had three stories plus a basement with a servants&#x2019; entrance&#x2014;the English middle class of the nineteenth century insisted on a servants&#x2019; entrance, even if they had no servants. Faber was a cynic about the English.</p><p>Number Six had been owned by Mr. Harold Garden, of Garden&#x2019;s Tea and Coffee, a small company that went broke in the Depression. Having lived by the principle that insolvency is a mortal sin, the bankrupt Mr. Garden had no option but to die. The house was all he bequeathed to his widow, who was then obliged to take in boarders. She enjoyed being a landlady, although the etiquette of her social circle demanded that she pretend to be a little ashamed of it. Faber had a room on the top floor with a dormer window. He lived there from Monday to Friday, and told Mrs. Garden that he spent weekends with his mother in Erith. In fact, he had another landlady in Blackheath, who called him Mr. Baker and believed he was a traveling salesman for a stationery manufacturer and spent all week on the road.</p><p>He wheeled his cycle up the garden path under the disapproving frown of the tall front-room windows. He put it in the shed and padlocked it to the lawn mower&#x2014;it was against the law to leave a vehicle unlocked. The seed potatoes in boxes all around the shed were sprouting. Mrs. Garden had turned her flower beds over to vegetables for the war effort.</p><p>Faber entered the house, hung his hat on the hall-stand, washed his hands and went in to tea.</p><p>Three of the other lodgers were already eating: a pimply boy from Yorkshire who was trying to get into the Army; a confectionery salesman with receding sandy hair; and a retired naval officer who, Faber was convinced, was a degenerate. Faber nodded to them and sat down.</p><p>The salesman was telling a joke. &#x201c;So the Squadron Leader says, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re back early!&#x2019; and the pilot turns round and says, &#x2018;Yes, I dropped my leaflets in bundles&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t that right?&#x2019; So the Squadron Leader says, &#x2018;Good God! You might&#x2019;ve hurt somebody!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The naval officer cackled and Faber smiled. Mrs. Garden came in with a teapot. &#x201c;Good evening, Mr. Faber. We started without you&#x2014;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Faber spread margarine thinly on a slice of wholemeal bread, and momentarily yearned for a fat sausage. &#x201c;Your seed potatoes are ready to plant,&#x201d; he told her.</p><p>Faber hurried through his tea. The others were arguing over whether Chamberlain should be sacked and replaced by Churchill. Mrs. Garden kept voicing opinions, then looking at Faber for a reaction. She was a blowsy woman, a little overweight. About Faber&#x2019;s age, she wore the clothes of a woman of thirty, and he guessed she wanted another husband. He kept out of the discussion.</p><p>Mrs. Garden turned on the radio. It hummed for a while; then an announcer said: &#x201c;This is the BBC Home Service. <i>It&#x2019;s That Man Again!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Faber had heard the show. It regularly featured a German spy called Funf. He excused himself and went up to his room.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Mrs. Garden was left alone after <i>It&#x2019;s That Man Again</i>; the naval officer went to the pub with the salesman; and the boy from Yorkshire, who was religious, went to a prayer meeting. She sat in the parlor with a small glass of gin, looking at the blackout curtains and thinking about Mr. Faber. She wished he wouldn&#x2019;t spend so much time in his room. She needed company, and he was the kind of company she needed.</p><p>Such thoughts made her feel guilty. To assuage the guilt, she thought of Mr. Garden. Her memories were familiar but blurred, like an old print of a movie with worn sprocket holes and an indistinct sound track; so that, although she could easily remember what it was like to have him here in the room with her, it was difficult to imagine his face or the clothes he might be wearing or the comment he would make on the day&#x2019;s war news. He had been a small, dapper man, successful in business when he was lucky and unsuccessful when he was not, undemonstrative in public and insatiably affectionate in bed. She had loved him a lot. There would be many women in her position if this war ever got going properly. She poured another drink.</p><p>Mr. Faber was a quiet one&#x2014;that was the trouble. He didn&#x2019;t seem to have any vices. He didn&#x2019;t smoke, she had never smelled drink on his breath, and he spent every evening in his room, listening to classical music on his radio. He read a lot of newspapers and went for long walks. She suspected he was quite clever, despite his humble job: his contributions to the conversation in the dining room were always a shade more thoughtful than anyone else&#x2019;s. He surely could get a better job if he tried. He seemed not to give himself the chance he deserved.</p><p>It was the same with his appearance. He was a fine figure of a man: tall, quite heavy around the neck and shoulders, not a bit fat, with long legs. And he had a strong face, with a high forehead and a long jaw and bright blue eyes&#x2014;not pretty like a film star, but the kind of face that appealed to a woman. Except for the mouth&#x2014;that was small and thin, and she could imagine him being cruel. Mr. Garden had been incapable of cruelty.</p><p>And yet at first sight he was not the kind of a man a woman would look at twice. The trousers of his old worn suit were never pressed&#x2014;she would have done that for him, and gladly, but he never asked&#x2014;and he always wore a shabby raincoat and a flat docker&#x2019;s cap. He had no mustache, and his hair was trimmed short every fortnight. It was as if he wanted to look like a nonentity.</p><p>He needed a woman; there was no doubt of that. She wondered for a moment whether he might be what people called effeminate, but she dismissed the idea quickly. He needed a wife to smarten him up and give him ambition. She needed a man to keep her company and for&#x2014;well&#x2014;love.</p><p>Yet he never made a move. Sometimes she could scream with frustration. She was sure she was attractive. She looked in a mirror as she poured another gin. She had a nice face and fair curly hair, and there was something for a man to get hold of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She giggled at that thought. She must be getting tiddly.</p><p>She sipped her drink and considered whether <i>she </i>ought to make the first move. Mr. Faber was obviously shy&#x2014;chronically shy. He wasn&#x2019;t sexless&#x2014;she could tell by the look in his eyes on the two occasions he had seen her in her nightdress. Perhaps she could overcome his shyness by being brazen. What did she have to lose? She tried imagining the worst, just to see what it felt like. Suppose he rejected her. Well, it would be embarrassing&#x2014;even humiliating. It would be a blow to her pride. But nobody else need know it had happened. He would just have to leave.</p><p>The thought of rejection had put her off the whole idea. She got to her feet slowly, thinking: I&#x2019;m just not the brazen type. It was bedtime. If she had one more gin in bed she would be able to sleep. She took the bottle upstairs.</p><p>Her bedroom was below Mr. Faber&#x2019;s, and she could hear violin music from his radio as she undressed. She put on a new nightdress&#x2014;pink, with an embroidered neckline, and no one to see it!&#x2014;and made her last drink. She wondered what Mr. Faber looked like undressed. He would have a flat stomach and hairs on his nipples, and you would be able to see his ribs because he was slim. He probably had a small bottom. She giggled again, thinking, I&#x2019;m a disgrace.</p><p>She took her drink to bed and picked up her book, but it was too much effort to focus on the print. Besides, she was bored with vicarious romance. Stories about dangerous love affairs were fine when you yourself had a perfectly safe love affair with your husband, but a woman needed more than Barbara Cartland. She sipped her gin and wished Mr. Faber would turn the radio off. It was like trying to sleep at a tea dance!</p><p>She could, of course, ask him to turn it off. She looked at her bedside clock; it was past ten. She could put on her dressing gown, which matched the nightdress, and just comb her hair a little, then step into her slippers&#x2014;quite dainty, with a pattern of roses&#x2014;and just pop up the stairs to the next landing, and just, well, tap on his door. He would open it, perhaps wearing his trousers and under- shirt, and then he would <i>look </i>at her the way he had <i>looked </i>when he saw her in her nightdress on the way to the bathroom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Silly old fool,&#x201d; she said to herself aloud. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just making excuses to go up there.&#x201d;</p><p>And then she wondered why she needed excuses. She was a grown-up, and it was her house, and in ten years she had not met another man who was just right for her, and what the <i>hell</i>? She needed to feel someone strong and hard and hairy on top of her, squeezing her breasts and panting in her ear and parting her thighs with his broad, flat hands, for tomorrow the gas bombs might come over from Germany and they would all die choking and gasping and poisoned and she would have lost her last chance.</p><p>So she drained her glass and got out of bed and put on her dressing gown, and just combed her hair a little and stepped into her slippers, and picked up her bunch of keys in case he had locked the door and couldn&#x2019;t hear her knock above the sound of the radio.</p><p>There was nobody on the landing. She found the stairs in the darkness. She intended to step over the stair that creaked, but she stumbled on the loose carpet and trod on it heavily; but it seemed that nobody heard, so she went on up and tapped on the door at the top. She tried it gently. It was locked.</p><p>The radio was turned down and Mr. Faber called out, &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>He was well-spoken, not cockney or foreign&#x2014;not anything, really, just a pleasantly neutral voice.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Can I have a word with you?&#x201d;</p><p>He seemed to hesitate; then he said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m undressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; she giggled, and she opened the door with her duplicate key.</p><p>He was standing in front of the radio with some kind of screwdriver in his hand. He wore his trousers and <i>no </i>undershirt. His face was white and he looked scared to death.</p><p>She stepped inside and closed the door behind her, not knowing what to say. Suddenly she remembered a line from an American film, and she said, &#x201c;Would you buy a lonely girl a drink?&#x201d; It was silly, really, because she knew he had no drink in his room and she certainly wasn&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>The Partners: Inside America&#39;s Most Powerful Law Firms</h2><p>A lawyer and journalist dissects the personalities and power of the nation&#39;s elite corporate law firms and traces their roles in pivotal political and economic events, such as the rescue of the American hostages in Iran</p><p></p><h2>Paper Pools</h2><p>Describes and illustrates the artist&#39;s original technique of fusing paper pulp and paper to depict images produced from photographs of the interplay of light and water within a swimming pool</p><p></p><h2>Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology, and Human Nature</h2><p>Three eminent scientists analyze the scientific, social, and political roots of biological determinism.</p><p>t scientists analyze the scientific, social, and political roots of biological determinism.Richard Lewontin: An American evolutionary biologist, geneticist, academic and social commentator.

What have we here<br> So very round and smooth and sharp?<br> To me 'tis mighty clear<br> This wonder of an Elephant<br> Is very like a spear!" </p><p> The Third approached the animal,<br> And happening to take<br> The squirming trunk within his hands,<br> Thus boldly up and spake:<br> "I see," quoth he, "The Elephant<br> Is very like a snake!" </p><p> The Fourth reached out an eager hand,<br> And felt around the knee,<br> "What most this wondrous beast is like<br> Is mighty plain," quoth he;<br> "'Tis clear enough the Elephant<br> Is very like a tree!" </p><p> The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,<br> Said: "E'en the blindest man<br> Can tell what this resembles most;<br> Deny the fact who can,<br> This marvel of an Elephant<br> Is very like a fan!" </p><p> The Sixth no sooner had begun<br> About the beast to grope,<br> Than, seizing on the swinging tail<br> That fell within his scope,<br> "I see," quoth he, "the Elephant<br> is very like a rope!" </p><p> And so these men of Indostan<br> Disputed loud and long,<br> Each of his own opinion<br> Exceeding stiff and strong,<br> Though each was partly in the right,<br> And all were in the wrong! </p><p> <b>Moral</b> </p><p> So oft in theologic wars,<br> The disputants, I ween,<br> Rail on in utter ignorance<br> Of what each other mean,<br> And prate about an Elephant<br> Not one of them has seen! </p><p> <br> We are the blind people and strategy formation is our elephant. Since no one has had the vision to see the entire beast, everyone has grabbed hold of some part or other and "railed on in utter ignorance" about the rest. We certainly do not get an elephant by adding up its parts. An elephant is more than that. Yet to comprehend the whole we also need to understand the parts. </p><p> The next ten chapters describe ten parts of our strategy-formation beast. Each forms one "school of thought." These ten chapters are framed by this first chapter, which introduces the schools as well as some ideas about strategy itself, and a last chapter which returns to the whole beast. </p><p> <b>Why Ten?</b> </p><p> In a colorful article entitled "The Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information," psychologist George Miller (1956) asked why we tend to favor a quantity of about seven for categorizing things -- for example seven wonders of the world, seven deadly sins, and seven days of the week. This reflects our cognitive makeup, he concluded: seven is about the number of "chunks" of information that we can comfortably retain in our short-term memories. Three wonders of the world would fall a little flat, so to speak, while eighteen would be daunting. But those of us interested in strategy are, of course, no ordinary mortals -- at least in terms of our cognitive capacities -- and so should be able to comprehend, say, one more than the magic number seven plus two. Accordingly, this book proposes ten schools of thought on strategy formation. </p><p> Cognition aside, in reviewing a large body of literature, ten distinct points of view did emerge, most of which are reflected in management practice. Each has a unique perspective that focuses, like each of the blind men, on one major aspect of the strategy-formation process. Each of these perspectives is, in one sense, narrow and overstated. Yet in another sense, each is also interesting and insightful. An elephant may not be a trunk, but it certainly has a trunk, and it would be difficult to comprehend elephants without reference to trunks. The handicap of blindness does have an unexpected advantage, sharpening the other senses to the subtleties that can escape those who see clearly. </p><p> <br> THE SCHOOLS. Accordingly, in each of the ten subsequent chapters, we present one of the schools from its own limited perspective. Then we critique it, to extract both its limitations and its contributions. These schools, together with the single adjective that seems best to capture each one's view of the strategy process, are listed below: </p><p> The Design School: strategy formation as a process of <i>conception</i><br> The Planning School: strategy formation as a <i>formal</i> process<br> The Positioning School: strategy formation as an <i>analytical</i> process<br> The Entrepreneurial School: strategy formation as a <i>visionary</i> process<br> The Cognitive School: strategy formation as a <i>mental</i> process<br> The Learning School: strategy formation as an <i>emergent</i> process<br> The Power School: strategy formation as a process of <i>negotiation</i><br> The Cultural School: strategy formation as a <i>collective</i> process<br> The Environmental School: strategy formation as a <i>reactive</i> process<br> The Configuration School: strategy formation as a process of <i>transformation</i> </p><p> Our ten schools fall into three groupings. The first three schools are <i>prescriptive</i> in nature -- more concerned with how strategies <i>should</i> be formulated than with how they necessarily <i>do</i> form. The first of these, which presented in the 1960s the basic framework on which the other two built, focuses on strategy formation as a process of informal <i>design,</i> essentially one of conception. The second school, which developed in parallel in the 1960s and peaked in a flurry of publications and practice in the 1970s, formalized that perspective, seeing strategy making as a more detached and systematic process of formal <i>planning.</i> That school was somewhat displaced in the 1980s by the third prescriptive school, less concerned with the process of strategy formation than with the actual content of strategies. It is referred to as the <i>positioning</i> school because it focuses on the selection of strategic positions in the economic marketplace. </p><p> The six schools that follow consider specific aspects of the process of strategy formation, and have been concerned less with prescribing ideal strategic behavior than with <i>describing</i> how strategies do, in fact, get made. </p><p> Some prominent writers have long associated strategy with <i>entrepreneurship,</i> and have described the process in terms of the creation of vision by the great leader. But if strategy can be personalized vision, then strategy formation has also to be understood as the process of concept attainment in a person's head. Accordingly, a small but important cognitive school has also developed that seeks to use the messages of cognitive psychology to enter the strategist's mind. </p><p> Each of the four schools that follow has tried to open up the process of strategy formation beyond the individual, to other forces and other actors. For the <i>learning</i> school, the world is too complex to allow strategies to be developed all at once as clear plans or visions. Hence strategies must emerge in small steps, as an organization adapts, or "learns." Similar to this, but with a different twist, is the <i>power</i> school, which treats strategy formation as a process of negotiation, whether by conflicting groups within an organization or by organizations themselves as they confront their external environments. In contrast to this is another school of thought that considers strategy formation to be rooted in the <i>culture</i> of the organization. Hence the process is viewed as fundamentally collective and cooperative. And then there are the proponents of an <i>environmental</i> school, organization theorists who believe strategy formation is a reactive process in which the initiative ties not inside the organization, but with its external context. Accordingly, they seek to understand the pressures imposed on organizations. </p><p> Our final group contains but one school, although it could be argued that this school really combines the others. We call it <i>configuration.</i> People in this school, in seeking to be integrative, cluster the various elements of our beast -- the strategy-making process, the content of strategies, organizational structures and their contexts -- into distinct stages or episodes, for example, of entrepreneurial growth or stable maturity, sometimes sequenced over time to describe the life cycles of organizations. But if organizations settle into stable states, then strategy making has to describe the leap from one state to another. And so, another side of this school describes the process as one of transformation, which incorporates much of the huge prescriptive literature and practice on "strategic change." </p><p> These schools have appeared at different stages in the development of strategic management. A few have already peaked and declined, others are now developing, and some remain as thin but nonetheless significant trickles of publication and practice. We shall describe each school in turn, with our own interpretation of its development and its difficulties, before concluding with our final integrative comments in the closing chapter. </p><p> Note that all of these schools can be found in the literature, often in very clearly delineated pockets: particular academic journals, special practitioner magazines, certain styles of books. But most are, or have been, equally evident in practice, both within organizations and from the consulting firms that serve them. Practitioners read and are influenced by the literature, just as the literature is influenced by the practice. So this is a book of the school of thought on strategy formation both in publication and in practice. </p><p> <br> <b>A Field Review</b> </p><p> The literature of strategic management is vast -- the number of items we reviewed over the years numbers close to 2,000 -- and it grows larger every day. Of course, not all of this comes from the field of management. All kinds of other fields make important contributions to our understanding of the strategy process. </p><p> William Starbuck has written that to discuss "all aspects of organization which are relevant to adaptation...means...that one could legitimately discuss everything that has been written about organizations." This is, in fact, an understatement, because the last word in the quotation should read "collective systems of all kinds." </p><p> What biologists write about the adaptation of species (for example it "punctuated equilibrium") can have relevance for our understanding of strategy as position ("niche"). What historians conclude about periods in the development of societies (such as "revolution") can help explain different stages in the development of organizational strategies (for example, "turnaround" as a form of "cultural revolution"). Physicists' descriptions of quantum mechanics and mathematicians' theories of chaos may provide insights into how organizations change. And so on. Add to this all the other literatures that are more commonly recognized as relevant to the study of organizations -- psychology on human cognition as well as leadership charisma, anthropology on cultures in society, economics on industrial organization, urban planning on formal planning processes, political science on public policy making, military history on strategies of conflict, and on -- and the result is an enormous, dispersed body of literature capable of rendering all sorts of insights. At the limit, strategy formation is not just about values and vision, competences and capabilities, but also about the military and the Moonies, crisis and commitment, organizational learning and punctuated equilibrium, industrial organization and social revolution. </p><p> We consider this literature in its own terms. We do not, however, seek to <i>review</i> it comprehensively. (We had no more wish to write several thousand pages than most people have to read it.) This, in other words, is a <i>field</i> review, not a literature review. We seek to <i>cover</i> the literature and the practice -- to set out its different angles, orientations, tendencies. In so doing, we cite published work either because it has been key to a school or else because it well illustrates a body of work. We apologize to the many insightful writers and consultants whose work is not mentioned; we hope that we have left out no significant bodies of work. </p><p> We must add one point, however. There is a terrible bias in today's management literature toward the current, the latest, the "hottest." This does a disservice, not only to all those wonderful old writers, but especially to the readers who are all too frequently offered the trivial new instead of the significant old. We express no such bias in this book. Ours is a review of the evolution as well as the current state of this field. Later in this book we argue that ignorance of an organization's past can undermine the development of strategies for its future. The same is true for the field of strategic management. We ignore past work at our own peril. Indeed, we believe that time works on the literature and practice of strategic management much like it works on wine in barrels: it reveals what is excellent. We therefore apologize to no one for reminding the reader of so many wonderful old publications. </p><p> <br> <b>Five Ps for Strategy</b> </p><p> The word <i>strategy</i> has been around for a long time. Managers now use it both freely and fondly. It is also considered to be the high point of managerial activity. For their part, academics have studied strategy extensively for about two decades now, while business schools usually have as their final required capstone a course in strategic management. The word <i>strategy</i> is so influential. But what does it really mean? </p><p> It is part of human nature to look for a definition for every concept. Most of the standard textbooks on strategy offer that definition, usually presented in the introductory chapter, more or less as follows: "top management's plans to attain outcomes consistent with the organization's missions and goals" (Wright et al.). No doubt such definitions have been dutifully memorized by generations of students, who have later used them in thousands of corporate reports. We offer no such easy definition here. Instead, we argue that strategy (not to mention ten such different schools about it) requires a number of definitions, five in particular (based on Mintzberg, 1987). </p><p> Ask someone to define strategy and you will likely be told that <i>strategy is a plan,</i> or something equivalent -- a direction, a guide or course of action into the future, a path to get from here to there. Then ask that person to describe the strategy that his or her own organization or that of a competitor <i>actually</i> pursued over the past five years -- not what they intended to do but what they really did. You will find that most people are perfectly happy to answer that question, oblivious to the fact that doing so differs from their very own definition of the term. </p>&lt;...</p><h2>Takin&#39; Care of Business: The Big Idea for Small Business by Brian Buffini (2011-05-03)</h2><p>Product In &#x201c;Takin' Care of Business: The BIG IDEA for Small Business,&#x201d; you'll learn the one critical element that determines success or failure for a small business.

Now in the great man&#x2019;s footsteps comes humorist and twenty-year Washington resident Christopher Buckley with the real story of the city&#x2019;s founding. Well, not really. We&#x2019;re just trying to get you to buy the book. But we can say with justification that there&#x2019;s never been a more enjoyable, funny, and informative tour guide to the city than Buckley. His delight as he points out things of interest is con-tagious, and his frequent digressions about his own adventures as a White House staffer are often hilarious.<br><br>In <b>Washington Schlepped Here</b>, Buckley takes us along for several walks around the town and shares with us a bit of his &#x201c;other&#x201d; Washington. They include &#x201c;Dante&#x2019;s Paradiso&#x201d; (Union Station); the &#x201c;Zero Milestone of American democracy&#x201d; (the U.S. Capitol); the &#x201c;Almost Pink House&#x201d; (the White House); and many other historical (and often hysterical) journeys. Buckley is the sort of wonderful guide who pries loose the abalone-like clich�s that cling to a place as mythic as D.C. Wonderfully insightful and eminently practical, <b>Washington Schlepped Here</b> shows us that even a city whose chief industry is government bureaucracy is a lot funnier and more surprising than its media-ready image might let on.</p><p>Christopher Buckley is the author of nine previous books, including <b>Thank You for Smoking</b>, <b>Little Green Men</b>, and, most recently, <b>No Way to Treat a First Lady</b>. He is editor of Forbes FYI magazine and has contributed more than fifty &#x201c;Shouts and Murmurs&#x201d; to <i>The New Yorker</i>.Walk One<br><br>Union Station<br><br>To board a train in New York's Penn Station is to descend into Dante's Inferno. To disembark in Washington's Union Station is to ascend into his Paradiso. This is one of the world's truly spectacular thresholds, and you're lucky, because for the first seven years I lived in Washington, it was shut for renovations--after the Congress, in its infinite wisdom, spent many millions turning it into a--it makes me twitch even to type the words--National Visitors Center for the Bicentennial in 1976. Only the United States Congress could have taken one of the country's most stunning interior spaces and turned it into, as E. J. Applewhite noted in his excellent book, Washington Itself, "a labyrinth of makeshift passages and a mean borax lobby that would disgrace a small-town motel...an unseemly pit with escalators to nowhere but with a large screen for an automated slide show called PAVE (for Primary Audio Visual Experience) to orient the visitor to sights he can see better by simply walking out to the sidewalk in front of the building."<br><br>I feel much better for having quoted that. To paraphrase Santayana, those who forget how Congress can waste your money are doomed to supply it with even more. But let us relax now into the beauty of this cathedral of transportation, while trying to forget for the moment that Congress is now in charge of "reforming" Amtrak.<br><br>It makes sense to start our first walk here, for two reasons. The first and obvious being that this might well be where you're arriving. The second is that Union Station was built at the turn of the century as part of a plan to finish what L'Enfant had begun. The station's architect was a man named Daniel H. Burnham, a Chicagoan who had been director of works for the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893. The Exposition's "Court of Honor," displaying buildings of even height, with lots and lots of statues and fountains, got America's architects to thinking that the slightly shabby, thrown-together melange that was the nation's capital could use some brightening up.<br><br>This led to the McMillan Commission of 1901, headed by Senator James McMillan of Michigan, a railroad magnate. And now I must eat my words about how Congress screws up everything, because in this case, it didn't. What it did was to appoint the country's aesthetic A-Team--Burnham; New York architect Charles F. McKim; landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.; and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens--and send them on a seven-week tour of Europe to gather up ideas, then turn them loose on the capital city. The result, a Rome-on-the-Potomac landscape of gleaming white granite and marble buildings squatting on a vast green lawn, is the city that you are now standing in. Its trophies are Union Station, the Lincoln Memorial, the Reflecting Pool, the Memorial Bridge to Arlington, the Federal Triangle. L'Enfant's Renaissance city, reborn as a Beaux Arts showcase.<br><br>Union Station's vast scale isn't simply due to the fact that its builder tended to think big, but has a more practical reason: to accommodate the crowds at presidential inaugurals. As Applewhite notes, every president from Woodrow Wilson to Harry Truman arrived here by train for his inauguration. When the hotels reached maximum occupancy, visitors slept in Pullman sleeping cars on sidings. FDR's and Eisenhower's funeral trains set out from here. Robert F. Kennedy's arrived here. These were great events that took place on a worthy stage. The spectacle of coffins loaded onto military planes in air force hangars or tarmacs have little of the same grandeur.<br><br>The building that Union Station replaced was the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station. It was here that Abraham Lincoln, under conditions of secrecy and disguise, arrived for his inaugural in 1861, and from here that the funeral train carrying his martyred remains departed for the long journey home in 1865. The trip to Washington, fraught with peril and threat of assassination as it was, had its comic moments, not that they were funny at the time. Lincoln's young son Robert managed to lose his father's inaugural speech, and once Lincoln had been successfully snuck into the ladies' entrance to Willard's Hotel, his bodyguard Allan Pinkerton cabled in code to his fellow agents: "Plums delivered nuts safely!" Presidential guards are no longer allowed to send cables.<br><br>Burnham based the Union Station's central hall on the one in the Baths of Diocletian in Rome. I just looked up Diocletian in the encyclopedia: aside from imposing wage and price controls throughout the Roman Empire--<br><br>making him the Richard Nixon of his day--his other distinction seems to be that he conducted the last great persecution of Christians. Whatever his sins, by Jupiter, he made sure Romans bathed.<br><br>There is a definite "Roman thing"--as my former boss, Vice President Bush, would have put it--going on in Washington. To be sure, Gore Vidal has written more or less his entire impressive oeuvre on this theme. At the city's beginning, there was even a creek named "Tiber" running where Constitution Avenue now does. Rome had Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg splashing in the Trevi fountain; we got Wilbur Mills and Fanne Foxe leaping into the Tidal Basin. But Washington may be the only modern city left with functioning Roman-style temples. By functioning, I don't mean that people are slitting open peacocks and roasting bullocks. The Park Service would probably fine you for that. But gods are being worshiped in these temples. We'll explore this more fully when we get to the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials.<br><br>For now, set your bags down and enjoy the incredible space you're in. Then walk to the main doors, where you'll hear Jimmy Stewart bubbling over with excitement: "Oh, look, look! There it is! The Capitol Dome!"<br><br>United States Capitol<br><br>The Zero Milestone, a little nub of stone marking the precise spot from which all distances from Washington are supposed to be measured, is just south of the White House. The Capitol Building, meanwhile, is the Zero Milestone of American democracy. Any movie set in Washington, any New Yorker cartoon, will show the dome perfectly framed in a window. It is the ur-symbol for "United States of America." To be sure, there are days--most days, perhaps--when what goes on inside this gleaming white hive is enough to make you wonder if we really did the right thing back in 1776.<br><br>There's a wonderful oil painting from 1844 done by William McLeod showing what Capitol Hill looked like from where Union Station is today. It could be a tranquil Constable landscape depicting Wiltshire or the Cotswolds, only there's this odd Roman temple plunked down in the middle of it.<br><br>The landscape that greets you today as you walk out of the Union Station is slightly changed. The first thing you'll probably notice is the absence of cows. But once you've crossed Massachusetts Avenue, and you start up the Hill, it does get bucolic, if not quite by McLeod's standards. In 1809, according to the WPA Guide, the British ambassador "put up a covey of quail" right around here. Et in Arcadia blam blam.<br><br>In the 1870s, Jenkins Hill, the "pedestal" that L'Enfant had envisioned as "waiting for a monument" (the "Congress House"), was transformed into an urban garden space by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. He had by then completed a masterpiece, New York's Central Park. Here he had 131 acres to sculpt, dig, and mulch. In the northwest corner of the grounds, just in from the intersection of First Street N.W. and Constitution Avenue, you'll find the grotto that he built over a spring once frequented by local Indian tribes and travelers on their way west, to Georgetown. It's apt that a bubbling spring should have later become a rendezvous point for Woodward and Bernstein and their famous source, "Deep Throat."<br><br>I stood somewhere near here on January 20, 1981, and watched Ronald Reagan become the 40th president. I remember being amazed to think that Reagan should become the first president in history to be sworn in on the West Front of the Capitol Building. Here this glorious expanse, the Mall, America's front lawn--why on earth had all those other presidents chosen to give their inaugural speeches facing--a parking lot? At any rate, Reagan the Californian decided to give his speech facing the same direction that Lewis and Clark had, and it seemed apt, even if on that particular day America was focused east, specifically in the direction of Iran, where our embassy hostages were still being held after 444 days. (Joke at the time: What's flat and glows in the dark? Tehran, ten minutes after Reagan is inaugurated.)<br><br>By standing on the West Front, Reagan was also facing Arlington National Cemetery. In his speech, he quoted from the diary of a young American soldier named Martin Treptow, who had been killed in World War I. Reagan said he would try to act as Treptow had pledged to, "cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone." It was a lovely sentiment, even if within a few hours the media had found out that that Martin Treptow wasn't buried at Arlington, but 1,100 miles away in Bloomer, Wisconsin. This would be the first of many clarifications over the next eight years issued by the White House press office. But I'll invoke my right as a Republican to go on remembering it as a stirring moment nonetheless, wherever the hell Marvin Treptow is buried. How many Republicans does it take to change a lightbulb? Three: one to change it, one to mix the martinis, one to reminisce about how good the old one was.<br><br>Let's continue on up the hill. Don't trip over any Jersey barriers.

And when we implement that worldview as citizens of our great nation, we make travel a political act. Here are my top ten practical tips for doing just that:<br><br><b>1. Get out of your comfort zone.</b> Chose Managua over Mazatl�n, or Turkey over Greece. When visiting Israel, make time to also explore the West Bank. You can enjoy far richer experiences for far less money by venturing away from the mainstream.<br><br><b>2. Connect with people and try to understand them.</b> Make itinerary decisions that put you in touch with locals who are also curious about you. Stay in people&#x2019;s homes (via Airbnb.com or Couchsurfing.org) and spend time with your hosts. Go to a university, eat in the cafeteria, and make a new friend. Then, seek answers for cultural riddles: Why do Hindus feed their cows better than their children? Why do many Muslim women wear scarves? Why do Americans so fiercely defend their right to own a gun? Why do Norwegians so willingly pay such high taxes?<br><br><b>3. Celebrate diversity and be a cultural chameleon.</b> When encountering a cultural difference, embrace it with joy rather than with judgment...and actually join in: Eat with your fingers in Sri Lankan restaurants that have no silverware, dip your fries in mayonnaise in Belgium, smoke a hookah in Greece, get your ears cleaned in India, kiss a stranger on both cheeks in France, and go to a hurling match in Ireland. Rather than gawking at the pilgrims, become one climb Rome's Scala Santa (Holy Stairs) on your knees, feeling the pain while finding comfort in the frescoes of saints all around you.<br><br><b>4. Understand the contemporary context.</b> While traveling, get caught up on local news. Read <i>The Times of India</i> in Mumbai. Go to a political rally in Scotland. Listen to expat radio on Spain&#x2019;s Costa del Sol. Think about how all societies are on parallel evolutionary tracks. Imagine how the American approach to vexing societal problems might work in other places and (more importantly) vice versa.<br><br><b>5. Empathize with the other 96% of humanity.</b> Just like Americans have the American Dream, others have their own dreams. Make a point to put yourself in the shoes (or sandals, or bare feet) of the people you meet. Find out why Basque people are so passionate about their language. Drinking with Catholics in a Northern Ireland pub, discuss the notion of the tyranny of the majority...and then find a parallel in your society. As you travel, learn to celebrate the local Nathan Hales and Ethan Allens Turkey&#x2019;s Atat�rk, El Salvador&#x2019;s Oscar Romero, South Africa&#x2019;s Mandela, and so on.<br><br><b>6. Identify and undermine your own ethnocentricity.</b> The US has been preoccupied with terrorism for the last generation. But other nations have their own, sometimes even heavier baggage. Ponder societal needs even more fundamental than freedom and democracy. Why is Putin so popular in Russia? Why would a modern and well-educated Egyptian be willing to take a bullet for the newest military dictator (as my friend in Cairo just told me)? Why, in some struggling countries, does stability trump democracy?<br><br><b>7. Accept the legitimacy of other moralities.</b> Be open to the possibility that controversial activities are not objectively "right" or "wrong." Consider Germany's approach to prostitution or the Netherlands' marijuana policy, which are both based on pragmatic harm reduction rather than moralism. Get a French farmer&#x2019;s take on force-feeding his geese to produce foie gras. Pop in on a circumcision party to help celebrate a young Turkish boy&#x2019;s coming of age. Ask a Spaniard why bullfighting still thrives as the national pastime and why it's covered not in the sports pages, but in the arts section of the local newspaper. You don't have to like their answer, but at least try to understand it.<br><br><b>8. Sightsee with an edge.</b> Seek out political street art...and find out what it means. Read local culture magazines and attend arts and political events. Take alternative tours to learn about heroin maintenance clinics in Switzerland, Copenhagen's Christiania commune, and maquiladora labor in Tijuana. Walk with a local guide through a slum in a developing country. Meeting desperately poor villagers living with a spirit of abundance, ponder how so many rich people live with a mindset of scarcity.<br><br><b>9. Make your trip an investment in a better world.</b> Our world has a lot of desperation, and travelers are the lucky few who can afford to experience what's outside their own hometowns. Travel with a goal of good stewardship the idea that each traveler has a responsibility to be an ambassador to, and for, the entire planet. Think of yourself as a modern-day equivalent of the medieval jester: sent out by the king to learn what&#x2019;s going on outside the walls, and then coming home to speak truth to power...even if annoying.<br><br><b>10. Make a broader perspective your favorite souvenir.</b> Back home, be evangelical about your newly expanded global viewpoint. Travel shapes who you are. Weave favorite strands of other cultures into the tapestry of your own life. Live your life as if it shapes the world and the future...because it does. Believe that you matter. Then make a difference.<br><br><i>Rick Steves has collected a lifetime of travel lessons into the new, second edition of his book,</i> Travel as a Political Act.<br></p><h2>The World Of Biblical Literature</h2><p>Discusses the implications involved in studying the Bible as a literary text, comments on the new wave of literary biblical studies, and reexamines the verses that have dictated an entire culture</p><p>Alter's books on biblical narrative and poetics (ed., The Literary Guide to the Bible, 1987; The Art of Biblical Narrative, 1981) are bench-mark works in contemporary biblical lit-crit, and Alter has seen the field grow up around him into something fertile, even crowded. So it isn't altogether surprising here to see Alter, in the first of these diverse essays, swat and gesture at and shoo- away some of his colleagues (though it seems a rather too defensive defense). More interesting concerns go forth in essays on the Bible as literature (``The remaining, powerful peculiarity of the Bible is that it is a literature steeped in the quirkiness and imperfection of the human that is ultimately oriented toward a horizon beyond the human''); on the literal, about which Alter can see ``no real contradiction between literal and figurative readings of the Bible''; on allusion; and on Harold Bloom's Book of J thesis, which receives a scolding for being based, Alter argues, on a scandalously inaccurate translation of the text's Hebrew by David Rosenberg. As always with Alter (and as it should be, no doubt), he is on more solid ground when specific--carefully and thoroughly examining biblical excerpts--than he is when responding to less tangible theories. Still, a good companion volume to Alter's more focused studies. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Alter, a noted scholar of the Bible as literature, complements his previous studies (such as The Art of Biblical Narrative , LJ 8/81) by continuing to explore the assumptions that make a literary reading of the Bible possible. To some, such an approach may seem irreverent, but this is far from Alter's aims. Granted, he believes the anonymous biblical writers were engaged in literary activity, but their personality was subsumed to the "imaginative authority" of the text and to "an order of truth that utterly transcends literature." Examples of Alter's detailed literary analyses of several typically laconic texts reveal the hidden richness of syntax, motifs, and allusion. While it is not the purpose of literary analysis to confirm faith, Alter maintains that neither is it detrimental to faith nor the spiritual authority of the texts.

A true artist created not art, but feelings: homesickness, longing, terror, love. Most of all, Taylor's art teacher warned her against making mountains look like ice cream cones.<br><br> Taylor could state with great assurance the mountains she had sketched did not look like ice cream cones.&nbsp;They looked like ingrown toenails.<br><br> She rifled through her sketch pad, looking at each and every one of her drawings. How had she reduced the imperious majesty of the Idaho mountains to such a disgusting human condition?<br><br> She had dreamed of and planned for this, imagined her artistic talent would blossom in the light of a place and time so long cherished in her childhood memories. Instead, here she sat alone at the edge of a wide mountain meadow, and she was earthbound, her soul firmly chained to a drawing pad and a pack of pencils. She was almost relieved when she heard a car bouncing along the washboard gravel road behind her. She shut her drawing tablet, stowed her pencil, slid off the rock and headed into the stand of pines.<br><br> Not that she needed to hide. This was a national forest. But she was a woman alone. Sure, the car probably contained a rancher or some tourists. But wild game attracted out-of-season hunters, old gold claims dotted the creeks, and longtime residents carried guns. Up here in this wilderness, it was better to be safe than sorry.<br><br> She wound her way into the shadows of the trees, watching to see who had trekked so far into the backcountry.<br><br> When a black Mercedes came around the bend, hitting every rut as if it was a personal challenge, she grinned.<br><br> Tourists. Rich tourists. She wondered how far they would make it before they destroyed their car's oil pan on an inconveniently placed rock.

They passed out of sight behind a boulder as big as a house, and there the sound of the engine cut out.<br><br> She glanced at her watch. Two-thirty. Pretty soon, she needed to return to her rental Cherokee, too. It was a good two hours back to Sun Valley. She started deeper into the woods, looking for something less imposing to sketch.

He lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray&#x2019;s earliest works were written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith; they were actually an extension of his pastoral work. Once books such as<i> Abide in Christ, Divine Healing, </i>and<i> With Christ in the School of Prayer </i>were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness throughout the world.<br> He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.<br> At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.<br> During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Andrew Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.<br> One source has said of Andrew Murray that his prolific style possesses the strength and eloquence that are born of deep earnestness and a sense of the solemnity of the issues of the Christian life. Nearly every page reveals an intensity of purpose and appeal that stirs men to the depths of their souls. Murray moves the emotions, searches the conscience, and reveals the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.<br> For Andrew Murray, prayer was considered our personal home base from which we live our Christian lives and extend ourselves to others. During his later years, the vital necessity of unceasing prayer in the spiritual life came to the forefront of his teachings. It was then that he revealed the secret treasures of his heart concerning a life of persistent and believing prayer.<br> Countless people the world over have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his priceless devotional books.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Relationship Strategies : The E &amp; P Attraction</h2><p><i>Relationship Strategies</i> is the most important relationship book you will ever read. <i>Relationship Strategies</i> reveals at last why we chose the partners we chose in relationships, why the honeymoon stage ends, why one partner starts to want sex more than the other and why we repeat the same patterns in relationships over and over. <i>Relationship Strategies</i> explains the subconscious forces that dictate our behavior in relationships and how to get those powerful forces working for us instead of against us.</p><p>"...the best book I've ever read!...absolutely the closest thing to being able to read and possibly write your future!..." -- <i>Thomas Plunkett, December 1999, Atlanta, GA</i></p><h2>Bloodmoney: A Novel of Espionage</h2><p><p>From the author of the best-selling <em>Body of Lies</em> and <em>The Increment</em>: in a tragedy of revenge, the CIA falls victim to its own daring operation in the Middle East.</p> Someone in Pakistan is killing the members of a new CIA intelligence unit that is trying to buy peace with America's enemies.

Machida focuses on works produced during the watershed 1990s, when surging Asian immigration had significantly altered the demographic, cultural, and political contours of Asian America, and a renaissance in Asian American art and visual culture was well underway. Machida conducted extensive interviews with ten artists working during this transformative period: women and men of Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese descent, most of whom migrated to the United States. In dialogue with the artists, Machida illuminates and contextualizes the origins of and intent behind bodies of their work. <i>Unsettled Visions</i> is an engrossing look at a vital art scene and a subtle account of the multiple, shifting meanings of &#x201c;Asianness&#x201d; in Asian American art.<p></p><p>Analyses of the work of individual artists are grouped around three major themes that Asian American artists engaged with during the 1990s: representations of the Other; social memory and trauma; and migration, diaspora, and sense of place. Machida considers the work of the photographers Pipo Nguyen-duy and Hanh Thi Pham, the printmaker and sculptor Zarina Hashmi, and installations by the artists Tomie Arai, Ming Fay, and Yong Soon Min. She examines the work of Marlon Fuentes, whose films and photographs play with the stereotyping conventions of visual anthropology, and prints in which Allan deSouza addresses the persistence of Orientalism in American popular culture. Machida reflects on Kristine Aono&#x2019;s museum installations embodying the multigenerational effects of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and on Y. David Chung&#x2019;s representations of urban spaces transformed by migration in works ranging from large-scale charcoal drawings to multimedia installations and an &#x201c;electronic rap opera.&#x201d;</p></p><p>"For years, Margo Machida was practically the only person to bring Asian American artists into what were then the `multicultural' debates, and the only writer/participant to cover their activities and art with a high degree of social vision and intellectual passion. With Unsettled Visions, she has produced a work of amazing breadth, positioning each artist's work in an internationally historical, political, and theoretical context that considerably deepens my own understanding of art I have been familiar with for years."-- Lucy R. Lippard, author of Mixed Blessing: New Art in a Multicultural America <p>"Unsettled Visions is an engaging and extremely significant book beyond the fact that it is the first study to examine Asian American visual productions in a systematic way. It sets a high standard, and will be the model for works that follow."-- Gary Y. Okihiro, author of The Columbia Guide to Asian American History</p>&#34;This is a foundational text for appreciating and interpreting contemporary Asian American art. It is an intelligent and intelligible work built on many years of dedicated research and original thinking. Margo Machida has obviously been inspired by deep encounters with the art emanating from this marvelously complex demographic. &#34;Unsettled Visions&#34; has set the standard for the field.&#34;--Franklin Odo, Director, Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Program</p><h2>How to Be Sexy</h2><p><p>Everyone has what it takes to be sexy.

As the text briefly describes the tiny insect's physical and behavioral characteristics, natural habitats, life cycle, diet, and enemies, it suggests that one imagine becoming an ant, taking on specific physical characteristics as they are mentioned and performing some of a worker ant's tasks. Vibrant paintings?most of which are two-page spreads?show a variety of ant species in natural settings as they engage in food gathering, fighting off enemies, tending larvae or the queen, etc. An appendix identifies the species depicted by common name. While the lilting, clearly written text is well organized, some useful information is omitted. For instance, terms such as "larvae," "cocoon," and "pupae" are not defined. Aphids are mentioned, but not identified as insects and no explanation is given as to how ants "sip honeydew" from them. Also, the environments shown are too pristine to be completely realistic. Arthur Dorros's Ant Cities (HarperCollins, 1988) provides more detailed information of life within an ant colony, but lacks Brenner's imaginative approach to the subject and Schwartz's anatomically precise paintings. Minor flaws aside, Thinking About Ants will give young readers a good idea of what an ant's life is really like.?Karey Wehner, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 2-3, younger for reading aloud. Brenner invites readers to get down--way down--and take a close look at ants: their colors, bodies, diet, natural enemies, colonies, and reproductive cycle. Schwartz makes the mental foray easy with a set of crisply drafted close-up paintings that somehow avoid being frightening--even when depicting a full-page view of an insect head or soldier ants ripping interlopers into fragments. The author breaks her easy narrative into short, occasionally rhyming sentences or phrases, framing many as questions; the text and large, clear pictures combine to make this an unusually promising candidate for a read-aloud science book. Children sharp enough to ask what kinds of ants they're seeing here will find the 11 varieties indexed at the end, and for more detail about ant lives and habits, follow this up with Arthur Dorros' <i>Ant Cities</i> (1987). <i>John Peters</i></p><h2>Confessions of a Spy: The Real Story of Aldrich Ames</h2><p>The author of Family of Spies draws on interviews with KGB spy Aldrich Ames and the agents who caught him to offer a thorough account of the man and the unprecedented damage he did to the CIA. 80,000 first printing. $75,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Pete Earley, a former reporter for <b>The Washington Post</b>, is the author of seven works of nonfiction, including the bestsellers <b>The Hot House</b> and <b>Family of Spies</b>, and the multi-award-winning <b>Circumstantial Evidence</b>. According to the <b>Washingtonian</b> magazine, he is one of ten journalist/authors in America "who have the power to introduce new ideas and give them currency." Earley is also the author of two novels.Double agent Aldrich Ames fed the KGB sensitive information for many years, resulting in the death of many U.S. agents in Russia. By way of rare and invaluable interviews, Pete Earley has formulated the most accurate and detailed summary of the events that led to Ames&#39;s arrest. Edward Holland painstakingly guides the listener through the complicated web of Ames&#39;s life, from his early experiences in Burma with his double agent/professor father to his ultimate arrest. Holland&#39;s grandfatherly narration of Ames&#39;s transcendence from wide-eyed schoolboy to frustrated and self-justifying double agent almost convinces the listener that Earley was simply sick and tired of participating in a world of bureaucratic incompetence and hypocrisy. This sympathetic interpretation depicts a man who lost the meaning and purpose of his work and, ultimately, his direction in life. B.J.P.

With the exception of Percival's tale (``When he seated himself and began to move the white chessmen, the red men moved of themselves. Three times they checkmated him. It came to him then that only magic could defeat him in this way''), the tone is one of high seriousness, a record of cloven heads and other knightly deeds in the service of destiny and, occasionally, good. A few personal details aside (Mordred's ``foxy smile and gimlet eyes''), characters are stylized and remote, and the story is much simplified; Lancelot never touches Guinevere, and everyone goes after the Holy Grail without the authors explaining what it is. Still, this does preserve the flavor and major themes of the Arthurian Legend, with some modern additions--``Take comfort,'' says the dying king. ``Fear nothing. Trust in yourselves and do the best that you may.'' An accessible introduction for readers intimidated by Howard Pyle's collections, and a fresh inspiration for storytellers. Illustrations not seen. (Folklore. 10-12) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Stirring and stately, these nine tales of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table sparkle with the rich language of professional storytellers. They revive the legends of Merlin's passage to adulthood, young Arthur's drawing of the sword from the stone and the various ascents to Camelot by Guinevere, Lancelot and Galahad. Romance and adventure ring freshly here: "Arthur's sword was so bright in his enemies' eyes that it gave light like thirty torches." And, "All the beauty and grace under heaven were in the light of Guinevere's eyes." Frampton's black-and-white woodcuts, competent but unimaginative, impart an old world flavor. On the other hand, Hodges and Evernden's faithfulness to the sources and carefully considered retellings result in a challenging but not unwieldy read.

Since graduating he made Oxford his home and lives there still, although he now commutes into London. <br>If there is an answer to the question, it is this: because our bodies are designed to lie in boxes in the dark; arms neatly folded on our chests. Feet together. Eyes tight shut. This is why we die: it&#x2019;s the end we were shaped for.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . When she unwrapped her arms, her hands touched the cold sides of the container she&#x2019;d been planted in, and she understood that everything that passed for normal had slipped out of reach. She was in a world of new instructions&#x2014;try not to whimper; try not to scream; especially, try not to breathe. She had never been good with instructions. But these bore down with the weight of the earth, and could not be ignored.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And everything that had ever happened carried on happening elsewhere; out of sight or reach, in a time closed off to her. She recognized this, and even as she forgot her instructions and began to scream, felt the intense regret of being out of the loop&#x2014;of knowing that, whatever came next, she&#x2019;d play no part in it; nor ever know how it came out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this, too, is why we die; because we are only part of the story. And never to know how the story ends.<br><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br>Death was on his mind when he first saw the woman. It was her dress caught his eye; a white cotton dress that hung just above her knees, patterned with large blue almost-leaf shapes. <i>Like a Matisse in motion</i> he thought, then wondered where that had come from&#x2014;Matisse? Leaving the bar, descending the steps into the hotel lounge, she paused and looked round, verifying the obvious; that all of the tables were taken. The sunlight breaking from the window behind her lent shifting life to the dress she wore.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What death wore, he didn&#x2019;t know yet, but the clever money was on black.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He returned to the book he wasn&#x2019;t reading. Words swam into vision, took their usual route to his brain, and evaporated immediately, leaving no discernible impression. Twice in the last twenty minutes he&#x2019;d turned a page in case anybody was watching, and now did so again, noting as he did the way the same light that played with the pattern of her dress lay flat on the table before him: roomkey, wineglass, ashtray littered with corpses. If he turned, he&#x2019;d find the view through the window&#x2014;the car park, and the ivy trailing down the high wall separating the car park from whatever lay beyond.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will sir be eating this evening? he&#x2019;d been asked. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir wouldn&#x2019;t be eating this evening.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Last time Tim Whitby had been here, ten years to the day, he and Emma had been the only couple dining. That was how he remembered it. This evening it was full. Some of the room&#x2019;s occupants were presumably residents like himself; others were here just to eat. There was a futile permanence about the word resident, but that was how the bartender had identified him while taking his order. <i>If the information below is not correct, please amend by crossing out the names of persons no longer resident</i> Tim had read lately, on his electoral form, and had had to look for a pen . . . Some moments passed while this crawled across the landscape of his heart. And then the light altered, because the woman had approached and was gesturing at the unused half of his table. His face must have remained blank. She resorted to speech. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Do you mind?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sat on the far end of the sofa, leaving a good two feet between them; placed her glass and a folded newspaper on the table and leaned back, closing her eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On any list of things Tim did not want right now, company came first, second and third. For a start, it called for a rearrangement of his body. He compromised by pulling the ashtray closer; a gesture that ceded territory. He wasn&#x2019;t eating this evening. He wouldn&#x2019;t be taking up space much longer. He planned to have two, or possibly many more, glasses of wine, then go upstairs. Her being here did not alter his plan . . . This was a comfortable dining room, favouring armchairs and sofas. Guests weren&#x2019;t pressed to hurry. But soon she could have the long table to herself. He tried to convey all this in the way he picked up his glass, but it was impossible to know if she understood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wine&#x2014;which Emma had taught him to enjoy; he&#x2019;d been a beer man&#x2014;should have been a treat, but it was simply the next thing happening. He wasn&#x2019;t drunk yet. Just dislocated enough to feel his fingers rubbery as they negotiated glass back on to table; he didn&#x2019;t spill but sloshed a little; she didn&#x2019;t notice, because her eyes remained closed. She had long dark wavy hair&#x2014;almost black&#x2014;and maybe this made her skin seem paler than it was, or maybe it was pale anyway. And she wore a lot of make-up. This was presumably to cover a bruise on the side of her face nearest him&#x2014;not a terribly large bruise, nor old enough to have purpled and blacked, but definitely there, for all the careful layers she&#x2019;d painted on top. He looked away before her eyes could open, and let his gaze sweep the room once more. As if he had enemies who might have sneaked in while his mind roamed elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was nothing here that did not always happen: people eating, drinking, talking; being happy in a public place. The English were supposed to be repressed&#x2014;beaten to a pulp by the weather and an ineradicable sense of loss of empire. So why was everyone so bloody cheerful? In the far corner a young couple looked about two minutes off conceiving their first child, while in the opposite, a pair who might have been their grandparents were toasting each other with smiles whose wrinkles matched like bookends. The time it took Tim&#x2019;s gaze to cross from one to the other, a whole lifetime of promises had been kept and twice renewed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And waiters came and went, of course; and plates were scratched by knives and forks. Whatever the music was changed to something precisely as tasteful. Outside, a car left, and another arrived to take its place . . . All this just scratching Tim&#x2019;s surface, as if life were a TV he wasn&#x2019;t watching, but couldn&#x2019;t ignore. It was impossible, while alive, to divorce yourself from events: even the boring, even the stupid. When the last thing you wanted was conversation, you found yourself discussing the merits of various whiskies. When the last thing you wanted was company, a woman joined you, wearing a noticeable dress . . . Tim looked out of the window again; watched for a while early evening sunlight reflecting off the windscreen of a blue Toyota; a windscreen whose wipers had cleared a stylized M-shape on a background of reddish dust. He wondered why this detail mattered. He wondered why he bothered noticing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to stop. He returned to his book; the novel he was struggling through. It was a Graham Greene, one of Emma&#x2019;s. Emma had left her books behind. And though he&#x2019;d made a genuine effort to concentrate, the story&#x2019;s fundamental unreality hummed away beneath the narrative: it was set in 1953, for God&#x2019;s sake. Didn&#x2019;t the characters realize that? Didn&#x2019;t they understand they were interim; that the natural state of things was twenty-first century; that by the time they&#x2019;d caught up with history they&#x2019;d be dragging round colostomy bags, or cuffed to Zimmer frames, or just plain dead? Thatwas the problem: these people were dead, but didn&#x2019;t know it. It was the only convincing aspect of the story.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he looked back, her bruise seemed to have grown darker, and to his horror, she saw him notice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;It was a cupboard door.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . If he&#x2019;d left it baldly alone, if her statement had withered and died in contextless silence, they&#x2019;d both have remained frozen there forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were looking at my eye.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; Her voice was deep for a woman&#x2019;s, and carried a faint accent, though Tim couldn&#x2019;t register from where: never a strength of his.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He picked up his glass again. It was strange, and also expensive, how easily a glass of wine emptied&#x2014;though expense was hardly a consideration. Otherwise he&#x2019;d have stayed home, and drunk himself stupid on supermarket offers. Home, though, was not where he wanted to be, and as if he were broadcasting this thought out loud she picked up on it, and spoke again:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Have you been here before?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;. . . This hotel?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oxford.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived here. This was his home, where he did not want to be. Explaining that, though, would have involved open-heart surgery. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s our first visit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our</i> was an affront; one of those red flags the coupled wave to piss off the newly single. Lately, everywhere Tim went he saw people in pairs, flaunting happy, secure futures. And now it seemed even people turning up on their own had to trumpet their significant others. Tim had shared an <i>our</i> once; now he had simply a <i>his</i>. This unalterable fact made the woman&#x2019;s attempt to hide her bruise laughable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . But this was good, this was fine, this was nothing. It was a sequence of moments time would carry him through the way gravity would see him through a fall: there was little preparation needed; only the ordinary social stitching which held him together anyway&#x2014;which kept him saying <i>please</i> and <i>thank you</i> instead of<i> leave me alone</i>. He could smile pleasantly for as long as the situation demanded, which would not be terribly long, and all the while his alcoholic buzz would grow until it blotted out even the agonizingly pleasant chatter of the other diners. This woman would eventually run out of conversation and subside into silence. Tim would finish whatever drink he was on, nod politely, and go upstairs to his room. And there he would kill himself, and the whole fucking mess would be over.</p><h2>Eye</h2><p>Explores the theme of the human response to changing or threatening environments</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.After three fine collections celebrating SF greats Arthur C. Clarke, Fritz Leiber and Philip Jose Farmer, Preiss's Masterworks of SF &amp; Fantasy series hits a snag here. Herbert is one of the biggest names in the field but his best work has been of novel length (Dune, Hellstrom's Hive, etc.). While some of the themes of those books reappear here, the stories are generally mediocre because Herbert lacks the space for adequate background and characterization to make us care. Only the short "Seed Stock," about colonizing an alien world, delves beneath the plot mechanics. This collection might have been redeemed if, like the previous volumes, it had included a long autobiographical essay. In its place, however, is a short, weak defense of the movie version of Dune.

She lives in Nantucket, Massachusetts.On this early December day, snowflakes sparkled down to earth like granted wishes from a magic wand. <br><br> Inside the handsome lounge of The Haven, Yule logs blazed cheerfully in the fireplace, while Presley, Sinatra, and Springsteen sang Christmas carols. Near the long casement windows, five women were looping lights around a Norway spruce so tall they had to use a ladder to reach the highest branches.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, that&#x2019;s the end of the last string,&#x201d; Marilyn called from behind the fat tree.<br><br> &#x201c;Plug them in,&#x201d; Shirley told her.<br><br> Marilyn knelt to fit the plug into the socket.<br><br> &#x201c;Oooooooh!&#x201d; Shirley, Faye, Alice, Marilyn, and Polly sighed with delight as dozens and dozens of multicolored miniature lights twinkled to life.<br><br> &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Shirley announced, &#x201c;for the fun part. How shall we do this?&#x201d; Shirley was the director of The Haven, but the four other women were her best friends, practically her family, and she wanted to please everyone.<br><br> &#x201c;I think we should all hang the ornaments we brought where we want,&#x201d; Polly suggested.<br><br> &#x201c;But keep in mind,&#x201d; Faye added, &#x201c;it will look better if the heaviest, biggest ornaments go on the bottom boughs, with the smaller ones on the higher branches.&#x201d; She was an artist, with an artist&#x2019;s eye.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but we don&#x2019;t want it to look too perfect,&#x201d; Alice insisted. &#x201c;We want it to look real.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good point, Alice,&#x201d; Shirley agreed. &#x201c;Perfection, as we all know, isn&#x2019;t real.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sometimes it is,&#x201d; Marilyn disagreed, in her thoughtful, vague way. &#x201c;The horseshoe crab, genus Limulus, for example, is perfect. Its design hasn&#x2019;t changed since the Triassic period, that&#x2019;s two hundred forty-five million years.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; Faye said gently, amused. &#x201c;Still, we really don&#x2019;t want to hang a horseshoe crab on the Christmas tree.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose not. Although one year we did.&#x201d; Marilyn smiled at the memory. She was a paleobiologist&#x2014;the others teasingly called her a pale old biologist&#x2014;and her grown son and her ex-husband were molecular geneticists. &#x201c;Teddy was nine, and fascinated with crustaceans and fossils, so we bored holes in lots of shells, slipped colored cords through, and hung the tree with crabs, mollusks, and gastropods.&#x201d;<br><br> Alice snorted with laughter. &#x201c;You are so weird!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Polly chimed in. &#x201c;David told me that he and Amy are hanging only homemade decorations on their tree. And my daughter-in-law is such a purist, she&#x2019;ll use only vegetable dyes, natural wood, straw, and such. Afterwards, they&#x2019;ll probably carry the tree outside and feed the entire thing to the goat.&#x201d;<br><br> The others laughed. As they talked, they moved back and forth from the tables and couches where the boxes of decorations were set out. Occasionally Shirley dropped another log on the fire.<br><br> The spacious room, with its casement windows, high ceilings, and mahogany paneling, seemed to glow with contentment. Once built to house a private boarding school, this old stone lodge had been abandoned for a few years. Then Shirley, with the help of her friends and a few investors, had bought it and opened The Haven, a premier spa and wellness resort with a burgeoning membership and second-floor condos for staff or friends.<br><br> She had staff (she had staff! Shirley, who had struggled financially most of her life, got a thrill every time she remembered that). But she hadn&#x2019;t wanted her staff to decorate the Christmas tree, and neither had her friends. They&#x2019;d wanted to do this together. They&#x2019;d agreed to bring three boxes of decorations each, and they&#x2019;d agreed to do it without advance discussion or collaboration, so their choices would be a surprise.<br><br> Now they worked quickly, climbing the ladder to adorn the top, stretching left and right, standing back to appraise, kneeling to the lowest branches, murmuring to themselves, exclaiming at what the others had chosen.<br><br> Shirley was a sucker for whimsical creatures with smiling faces: elves, snowmen, Santa Clauses, cherubs, fat angels with crooked smiles and tilted halos, fairies with freckles and yarn hair.<br><br> Faye had selected expensive glass ornaments: gorgeous faceted stars, elongated teardrops and iridescent icicles, extravagantly striped or translucent balls in gleaming gemstone colors.<br><br> Polly loved to cook. She&#x2019;d baked dozens of gingerbread men and women, sugar-cookie stars, leaping reindeer, trumpets and drummer boys and crescent moons, the absorbing, familiar activity bringing back memories of Christmases when her son was little. She&#x2019;d decorated them with colored icing, silver balls, and sprinkles of colored sugar, and glued ribbons firmly on the back, for hanging. She&#x2019;d also strung cranberries and popcorn on fishing wire and bought boxes of candy canes.<br><br> Alice, less sentimental and more practical, had chosen thirty of the skin care, cosmetic, and aromatherapy products on sale at The Haven, and tied their lavender boxes with glittering gold and silver bows.<br><br> Marilyn&#x2019;s contribution was a boxed set of antique ornaments from the Museum of Fine Arts, and a handmade collection of brass and enamel stars, sun, moon, and planets purchased from an Asian gentleman selling them from a rug on a sidewalk in Harvard Square.<br><br> When every ornament was hung, the five women stepped back to admire their handiwork. The mixture was eccentric, aesthetically enchanting, and wildly cheerful.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fabulous,&#x201d; Shirley said. &#x201c;Let me get my camera.&#x201d;<br><br> Alice said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pour the hot chocolate.&#x201d; She twisted the cap off a large Thermos and poured the fragrant liquid into Christmas mugs&#x2014;little gifts from her to the others. Then, without the slightest twinge of guilt, she took out a can of Reddi-whip, shook it, and topped the drinks with snowy swirls of the white concoction. After that, she opened a little plastic bag, dipped her hand in, and sprinkled dark chocolate shavings on the creamy peaks.<br><br> &#x201c;I brought some Christmas cookies&#x2014;without the glue.&#x201d; Polly opened a red and green tin, and the sweet, warm aroma of butter and sugar rose into the air.<br><br> Marilyn and Faye pushed two of the more comfortable wing chairs close to the sofa so they could all sit in a half-circle, facing the tree. Shirley returned from her office with the camera and began snapping shots of the tree and its trimmers.<br><br> Shirley wore purple Tencel pants with an emerald top that flattered her auburn hair. Her earrings and necklace were miniature battery-operated Christmas lights that blinked on and off.<br><br> Faye wore scarlet trousers in a silk-and-wool weave with a matching jacket over a sleeveless white shell. A chunky choker of garnet and jade circled her neck. Her white hair was held back with a matching barrette.<br><br> Plump, auburn-haired Polly wore jeans and a bright green sweater with white snowmen she&#x2019;d designed and knit herself.<br><br> Alice looked majestic in a velvet tunic and pants of swirling crimson and indigo, embellished with lavish gold embroidery. Earrings, necklace, and bracelets of heavy, scrolled gold gleamed against her dark skin.<br><br> Marilyn wore brown wool trousers and a shapeless gray sweater. She wasn&#x2019;t color-blind; she just kept forgetting to think about her clothing.<br><br> The five curled up on the sofa and settled into the chairs.<br><br> Shirley raised her mug. &#x201c;To the holidays!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To the holidays!&#x201d; the others toasted.<br><br> They all sipped the rich hot chocolate, and sighed in unison.<br><br> Faye focused dreamily on the twinkling tree. &#x201c;This is going to be the best Christmas ever!&#x201d;<br><br> Alice chuckled. &#x201c;Yes, and I&#x2019;m Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did you know,&#x201d; Shirley informed them, &#x201c;in the movie The Wizard of Oz, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, was played by an actress named Billie Burke when she was fifty-three years old?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding!&#x201d; Polly nearly spilled her cocoa. &#x201c;She looked so young! All that blond hair. The sparkling pink dress. The tiara.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wish I had that dress,&#x201d; Faye mused.<br><br> &#x201c;I wish I had her magic wand,&#x201d; Marilyn murmured.<br><br> Alice lazily turned her head toward Marilyn. &#x201c;Really.

What is happening? What has he done? Nothing makes sense until Samson discovers that the Secret Service has known all along where he is. In fact, they have never taken him off the payroll. And now they are prepared to return his freedom and good name -- but there are strings attached, strings that begin to tighten around his neck even before his plane lands in Vienna . . .</p><p><p>Born in London, Len Deighton served in the RAF before graduating from the Royal College of Art (which recently elected him a Senior Fellow). While in New York City working as a magazine illustrator he began writing his first novel, The Ipcress File, which was published in 1962. He is now the author of more than thirty books of fiction and non-fiction. At present living in Europe, he has, over the years, lived with his family in ten different countries from Austria to Portugal.</p>Deighton's novels Berlin Game , Mexico Set and London Match initiated the stories about British secret agent Bernard Samson, whose wife Fiona has defected to the U.S.S.R. As narrated by Samson, the three tales are intensely exciting, a quality that continued at high pitch in Spy Hook , the first volume in the new trilogy. This is the second, opening with Samson in Berlin, a fugitive from England where the intelligence service accused him of spying for the Soviets. With the CIA and KGB also menacing him, Samson is suddenly cleared of the charge of treason and returned to London and to warm welcomes from colleagues, his lover Gloria and his children. The situation changes, however, when he's sent on a "simple" mission to Vienna and a deep-cover meeting with Fiona. In the resulting events, the loyal agent's safety becomes even more tenuous than it was during his darkest days in Berlin. Maintaining unrelenting tension and chronicling an escalation of intrigue and violent death, the new thriller will make readers eager for the answers in the next. 200,000 first printing; BOMC selection. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Journey Into Fear and Other Great Stories of Horror on the Railways</h2><p>A compilation of tales of horror drawn from fact and fiction includes stories of ghostly trains, stations, railwaymen, and passengers by F.

This book tells teens how to take control of their lives and get a &#34;real life.&#34; Young people can reclaim their natural ability to teach themselves and design a personalized education program. Grace Llewellyn explains the entire process, from making the decision to quit school, to discovering the learning opportunities available.</p><p>You won't find this book on a school library shelf--it's pure teenage anarchy. While many homeschooling authors hem and haw that learning at home isn't for everyone, this manifesto practically tells kids they're losers if they do otherwise. With the exception of a forwarding note to parents, this book is written entirely for teenagers, and the first 75 pages explain why school is a waste of time. Grace Llewellyn insists that people learn better when they are self-motivated and not confined by school walls. Instead of homeschooling, which connotes setting up a school at home, Llewellyn prefers "unschooling," a learning method with no structure or formal curriculum. There are tips here you won't hear from a school guidance counselor. Llewellyn urges kids to take a vacation--at least for a week--after quitting school to purge its influence. "Throw darts at a picture of your school" or "Make a bonfire of old worksheets," she advises. She spends an entire chapter on the gentle art of persuading parents that this is a good idea. Then she gets serious. Llewellyn urges teens to turn off the TV, get outside, and turn to their local libraries, museums, the Internet, and other resources for information. She devotes many chapters to books and suggestions for teaching yourself science, math, social sciences, English, foreign languages, and the arts. She also includes advice on jobs and getting into college, assuring teens that, contrary to what they've been told in school, they won't be flipping burgers for the rest of their days if they drop out.<p> Llewellyn is a former middle-school English teacher, and she knows her audience well. Her formula for making the transition from traditional school to unschooling is accompanied by quotes on freedom and free thought from radical thinkers such as Steve Biko and Ralph Waldo Emerson. And Llewellyn is not above using slang. She capitalizes words to add emphasis, as in the "Mainstream American Suburbia-Think" she blames most schools for perpetuating. Some of her attempts to appeal to young minds ring a bit corny. She weaves through several chapters an allegory about a baby whose enthusiasm is squashed by a sterile, unnatural environment, and tells readers to "learn to be a human bean and not a mashed potato." But her underlying theme--think for yourself--should appeal to many teenagers. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How To Quite School And Get A Real Life And Education is for everyone who has ever gone to school or is interested in the current national debate over educational reforms, but it is especially relevant for teenagers and the parents or caregivers of teens. The Teenage Liberation Handbook presents some good reasons to think about quitting school, how to reclaim a natural ability to learn and become self-taught, how to get parental support and stay out of legal trouble, how to design a personalized education worth getting excited about, how to go to college without first going to highschool, how to find volunteer positions and/or apprenticeships and/or other work opportunities, and what other unschooled teens do with their time. As with most things in life, there's a right way and a wrong way -- The Teenage Liberation Handbook is a blueprint for the best way! -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Curious George Learns to Count from 1 to 100</h2><p>Curious George is a good little monkey, and always very curious.

The running itself was just something that had to be done, three days a week, like any other chore or responsibility. Rosalind Harper did what had to be done.</p><p>She ran for her health. A woman who&#x2019;d just had she could hardly say &#x201c;celebrated&#x201d; at this stage of her life her forty-seventh birthday had to mind her health. She ran to keep strong, as she desired and needed strength. And she ran for vanity. Her body would never again be what it had been at twenty, or even thirty, but, by God, it would be the best body she could manage at forty-seven.</p><p>She had no husband, no lover, but she did have an image to uphold. She was a Harper, and Harpers had their pride.</p><p>But, Jesus, maintenance was a bitch.</p><p>Wearing sweats against the dawn chill, she slipped out of her bedroom by the terrace door. The house was sleeping still. Her house that had been too empty was now occupied again, and rarely completely quiet any longer.</p><p>There was David, her surrogate son, who kept her house in order, kept her entertained when she needed entertaining, and stayed out of her way when she needed solitude.No one knew her moods quite like David.</p><p>And there was Stella, and her two precious boys. It had been a good day, Roz thought as she limbered up on the terrace, when she&#x2019;d hired Stella Rothchild to manage her nursery.Of course, Stella would be moving before much longer and taking those sweet boys with her. Still, once she was married to Logan and wasn&#x2019;t that a fine match they&#x2019;d only be a few miles away.</p><p>Hayley would still be here, infusing the house with all that youth and energy. It had been another stroke of luck, and a vague and distant family connection, that had Hayley, then six-months pregnant, landing on her doorstep. In Hayley she had the daughter she&#x2019;d secretly longed for, and the bonus of an honorary grandchild with the darling little Lily.She hadn&#x2019;t realized how lonely she&#x2019;d been, Roz thought, until those girls had come along to fill the void. With two of her own three sons moved away, the house had become too big, too quiet. And a part of her dreaded the day when Harper, her firstborn, her rock, would leave the guesthouse a stone&#x2019;s throw from the main.</p><p>But that was life. No one knew better than a gardener that life never stayed static. Cycles were necessary, for without them there was no bloom.</p><p>She took the stairs down at an easy jog, enjoying the way the early mists shrouded her winter gardens. Look how pretty her lambs ear was with its soft silvery foliage covered in dew. And the birds had yet to bother the bright fruit on her red chokeberry.</p><p>Walking to give her muscles time to warm, and to give herself the pleasure of the gardens, she skirted around the side of the house to the front.</p><p>She increased to a jog on the way down the drive, a tall, willowy woman with a short, careless cap of black hair. Her eyes, a honeyed whiskey brown, scanned the grounds the towering magnolias, the delicate dogwoods, the placement of ornamental shrubs, the flood of pansies she&#x2019;d planted only weeks before, and the beds that would wait a bit longer to break into bloom.</p><p>To her mind, there were no grounds in western Tennessee that could compete with Harper House. Just as there was no house that could compare with its dignified elegance.Out of habit, she turned at the end of the drive, jogged in place to study it in the pearly mists.</p><p>It stood grandly, she thought, with its melding of Greek Revival and Gothic styles, the warm yellow stone mellow against the clean white trim. Its double staircase rose up to the balcony wrapping the second level, and served as a crown for the covered entryway on the ground level.</p><p>She loved the tall windows, the lacy woodwork on the rail of the third floor, the sheer space of it, and the heritage it stood for.She had prized it, cared for it, worked for it, since it had come into her hands at her parents&#x2019; death. She had raised her sons there, and when she&#x2019;d lost her husband, she&#x2019;d grieved there.</p><p>One day she would pass it to Harper as it had passed to her. And she thanked God for the absolute knowledge that he would tend it and love it just as she did.What it had cost her was nothing compared with what it gave, even in this single moment, standing at the end of the drive, looking back through the morning mists.</p><p>But standing there wasn&#x2019;t going to get her three miles done. She headed west, keeping close to the side of the road, though there&#x2019;d be little to no traffic this early.To take her mind off the annoyance of exercise, she started reviewing her list of things to do that day.</p><p>She had some good seedlings going for annuals that should be ready to have their seed leaves removed. She needed to check all the seedlings for signs of damping off. Some of the older stock would be ready for pricking off.</p><p>And, she remembered, Stella had asked for more amaryllis, more forced-bulb planters, more wreaths and poinsettias for the holiday sales. Hayley could handle the wreaths. The girl had a good hand at crafting.</p><p>Then there were the field-grown Christmas trees and hollies to deal with. Thank God she could leave that end to Logan.</p><p>She had to check with Harper, to see if he had any more of the Christmas cacti he&#x2019;d grafted ready to go. She wanted a couple for herself.</p><p>She juggled all the nursery business in her mind even as she passed In the Garden. It was tempting it always was to veer off the road onto that crushed-stone entryway, to take an indulgent solo tour of what she&#x2019;d built from the ground up.Stella had gone all out for the holidays, Roz noted with pleasure, grouping green, pink, white, and red poinsettias into a pool of seasonal color in the front of the low-slung house that served as the entrance to the retail space. She&#x2019;d hung yet another wreath on the door, tiny white lights around it, and the small white pine she&#x2019;d had dug from the field stood decorated on the front porch.</p><p>White-faced pansies, glossy hollies, hardy sage added more interest and would help ring up those holiday sales.</p><p>Resisting temptation, Roz continued down the road.</p><p>She had to carve out some time, if not today, then certainly later this week, to finish up her Christmas shopping. Or at least put a bigger dent in it. There were holiday parties to attend, and the one she&#x2019;d decided to give. It had been awhile since she&#x2019;d opened the house to entertain in a big way.</p><p>The divorce, she admitted, was at least partially to blame for that. She&#x2019;d hardly felt like hosting parties when she&#x2019;d felt stupid and stung and more than a bit mortified by her foolish, and mercifully brief, union to a liar and a cheat.</p><p>But it was time to put that aside now, she reminded herself, just as she&#x2019;d put him aside. The fact that Bryce Clerk was back in Memphis made it only more important that she live her life, publically and privately, exactly as she chose.</p><p>At the mile-and-a-half mark, a point she judged by an old, lightning-struck hickory, she started back. The thin fog had dampened her hair, her sweatshirt, but her muscles felt warm and loose. It was a bitch, she mused, that everything they said about exercise was true.</p><p>She spotted a deer meandering across the road, her coat thickened for winter, her eyes on alert by the intrusion of a human.</p><p>You&#x2019;re beautiful, Roz thought, puffing a little on that last half mile. Now, stay the hell out of my gardens. Another note went in her file to give her gardens another treatment of repellant before the deer and her pals decided to come around for a snack.</p><p>Roz was just making the turn into the drive when she heard muffled footsteps, then saw the figure coming her way. Even with the mists she had no trouble identifying the other early riser.</p><p>They both stopped, jogged in place, and she grinned at her son.</p><p>&#x201c;Up with the worms this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thought I&#x2019;d be up and out early enough to catch you.&#x201d; He scooped a hand through his dark hair. &#x201c;All that celebrating for Thanksgiving, then your birthday, I figured I&#x2019;d better work off the excess before Christmas hits.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You never gain an ounce. It&#x2019;s annoying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feel soft.&#x201d; He rolled his shoulders, then his eyes, whiskey brown like hers, and laughed. </p><p> &#x201c;Besides, I gotta keep up with my mama.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked like her. There was no denying she&#x2019;d stamped herself on his face. But when he smiled, she saw his father. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be the day, pal of mine. How far you going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How far&#x2019;d you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three miles.&#x201d;</p><p>He flashed a grin. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll do four.&#x201d; He gave her a light pat on the cheek as he passed.&#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve told him five, just to get his goat.&#x201d; She chuckled, and slowing to a cool-down walk, started down the drive.</p><p>The house shimmered out of the mists. She thought: Thank God that&#x2019;s over for another day. And she circled around to go in as she&#x2019;d left.</p><p>The house was still quiet, and lovely. And haunted.</p><p>She&#x2019;d showered and changed for work, and had started down the central stairs that bisected the wings when she heard the first stirrings.</p><p>Stella&#x2019;s boys getting ready for school, Lily fussing for her breakfast. Good sounds, Roz thought. Busy, family sounds she&#x2019;d missed.</p><p>Of course, she&#x2019;d had the house full only a couple weeks earlier, with all her boys home for Thanksgiving and her birthday. Austin and Mason would be back for Christmas. A mother of grown sons couldn&#x2019;t ask for better. </p><p>God knew there&#x2019;d been plenty of times when they were growing up that she&#x2019;d yearned for some quiet. Just an hour of absolute peace where she had nothing more exciting to do than soak in a hot tub. </p><p>Then she&#x2019;d had too much time on her hands, hadn&#x2019;t she? Too much quiet, too much empty space. So she&#x2019;d ended up marrying some slick son of a bitch who&#x2019;d helped himself to her money so he could impress the bimbos he&#x2019;d cheated on her with. </p><p>Spilled milk, Roz reminded herself. And it wasn&#x2019;t constructive to dwell on it. </p><p>She walked into the kitchen where David was already whipping something in a bowl, and the seductive fragrance of fresh coffee filled the air. </p><p>&#x201c;Morning, gorgeous. How&#x2019;s my best girl?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Up and at &#x2019;em anyway.&#x201d; She went to a cupboard for a mug. &#x201c;How was the date last night?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Promising. He likes Grey Goose martinis and John Waters movies. We&#x2019;ll try for a second round this weekend. Sit yourself down. I&#x2019;m making French toast.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;French toast?&#x201d; It was a personal weakness. &#x201c;Damn it, David, I just ran three miles to keep my ass from falling all the way to the back of my knees, then you hit me with French toast.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You have a beautiful ass, and it&#x2019;s nowhere near the back of your knees.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yet,&#x201d; she muttered, but she sat. &#x201c;I passed Harper at the end of the drive. He finds out what&#x2019;s on the menu, he&#x2019;ll be sniffing at the back door.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m making plenty.&#x201d; </p><p>She sipped her coffee while he heated up the skillet. </p><p>He was movie-star handsome, only a year older than her own Harper, and one of the delights of her life. As a boy he&#x2019;d run tame in her house, and now he all but ran it. </p><p>&#x201c;David . . . I caught myself thinking about Bryce twice this morning. What do you think that means?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Means you need this French toast,&#x201d; he said while he soaked thick slices of bread in his magic batter. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve probably got yourself a case of the mid-holiday blues.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I kicked him out right before Christmas. I guess that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And a merry one it was, with that bastard out in the cold. I wish it had been cold,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;Raining ice and frogs and pestilence.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask you something I never did while it was going on. Why didn&#x2019;t you ever tell me how much you disliked him?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Probably the same reason you didn&#x2019;t tell me how much you disliked that out-of-work actor with the fake Brit accent I thought I was crazy about a few years back. I love you.&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good reason.&#x201d; </p><p>He&#x2019;d started a fire in the little kitchen hearth, so she angled her body toward it, sipped coffee, felt steady and solid. </p><p>&#x201c;You know if you could just age twenty years and go straight, we could live with each other in sin. I think that would be just fine.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sugar-pie.&#x201d; He slid the bread into the skillet. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only girl in the world who&#x2019;d tempt me.&#x201d; </p><p>She smiled, and resting her elbow on the table, set her chin on her fist. &#x201c;Sun&#x2019;s breaking through,&#x201d; she stated. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a pretty day.&#x201d; </p><p>A pretty day in early December meant a busy one for a garden center. Roz had so much to do she was grateful she hadn&#x2019;t resisted the breakfast David had heaped on her. She missed lunch. </p><p>In her propagation house she had a full table covered with seed trays. She&#x2019;d already separated out specimens too young for pricking off. And now began the first transplanting with those she deemed ready. </p><p>She lined up her containers, the cell packs, the individual pots or peat cubes. It was one of her favorite tasks, even more than sowing, this placing of a strong seedling in the home it would occupy until planting time. </p><p>Until planting time, they were all hers. </p><p>And this year she was experimenting with her own potting soil. She&#x2019;d been trying out recipes for more than two years now, and believed she&#x2019;d found a winner, both for indoor and outdoor use. The outdoor recipe should serve very well for her greenhouse purposes.From the bag she&#x2019;d carefully mixed, she filled her containers, testing the moisture, and approved. With care she lifted out the young plants, holding them by their seed leaves. Transplanting, she made certain the soil line on the stem was at the same level it had been in the seed tray, then firmed the soil around the roots with experienced fingers. </p><p>She filled pot after pot, labeling as she went and humming absently to the Enya playing gently from the portable CD player she considered essential equipment in a greenhouse.Using a weak fertilizer solution, she watered them. </p><p>Pleased with the progress, she moved through the back opening and into the perennial area. She checked the section plants recently started from cuttings, those started more than a year before that would be ready for sale in a few months. She watered and tended, then moved to stock plants to take more cuttings. She had a tray of anemones begun when Stella stepped in. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been busy.&#x201d; Stella, with her curling red hair bundled back in a tail, scanned the tables. &#x201c;Really busy.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And optimistic. We had a banner season, and I&#x2019;m expecting we&#x2019;ll have another.

Other books he has illustrated include &#34;Three Samurai Cats&#34; and &#34;The Jar of Fools: Eight Hanukkah Stories from Chelm&#34;, both written by Eric A. Kimmel. &#34;Publishers Weekly&#34; praised his artwork as &#34;inventive...bound to take any reader&#39;s breath away.&#34; He resides in western Massachusetts.The story of the binding of Isaac is not for the fainthearted. Abraham's willingness to slay his child, Isaac, in deference to God's wishes has provoked questions for millennia. So how does an author present a story so disturbing to many adults to an audience of children? Basing the story on Midrash, Jewish tales about Old Testament stories, Caldecott Medal-winner Gerstein frames his picture book around the pure white ram that ultimately takes Isaac's place. <p>The ram waits patiently in the Garden of Eden and beyond until God calls. More than once the Evil One tries to thwart him, but the ram insists, "I must save the child." He runs through swamps and jungles, leaps over lions, and finally scales the sacred mount, where he sees Isaac bound to an altar and Abraham weeping. After God intercedes with Abraham, the ram meets his fate "and his soul [flies] into God's hands." Children who don't know the story will be lost, but, of course, many will be familiar with the biblical tale. Gerstein offers an explanation about the necessity of the sacrifice through dialogue between Abraham and God, with Abraham wondering why God tested him, knowing that he would do whatever was asked. God replies, "I wanted the whole world to see your love and your trust in me so that all people might follow your example." This may temper the scene for some, even as it raises more questions for others. Of course, Gerstein can only work within the parameters of the original text. In that context, he tries hard to bring a sense of nobility to the story, embuing the ram with a fidelity that is heroic.</p><p>The art does not shy away from the fearsomeness of the story but it, too, attempts to offer hope. The intense painting, executed in inks, oils, and colored pencil, clearly depict both the evil in the world (as personified by a particularly fierce devilish character in several guises) as well as the power of God and His word. Gerstein uses shape and color to move the action through the lower realms of swamp and earth and then elevates the scene of the sacrifice on a high mountain. Though God is not seen, hints of his hands are visible in the clouds for those who look closely. Especially moving is the double-page spread that shows the broken ram on the altar, its spirit flying into the light. A stirring visual finale, on pages touched with gold, explains how the ram's ashes and bones came to build a great Temple, and how his horns will be used to call the people of Israel home. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A story needs more than the original idea...but the nightmare still shows through.<br>* * *<br>Only one figure stood in the airlock, though it was a cargo lock, easily big enough to hold both men. Lean and sandy haired, the tiny figure was obviously Carver Rappaport. A bushy beard now covered half its face. It waited patiently while the ramp was run up, and then it started down.<br>Turnbull, waiting at the bottom, suppressed growing uneasiness. Something was wrong. He'd known it the moment he heard that the <i>Overcee</i> was landing. The ship must have been in the solar system for hours. Why hadn't she called in?<br>And where was Wall Kameon?<br>Returning spacers usually sprinted down the ramp, eager to touch honest concrete again. Rappaport came down with slow, methodical speed. Seen close, his beard was ragged, unkempt. He reached bottom, and Turnbull saw that the square features were set like cement.<br>Rappaport brushed past him and kept walking.<br>Turnbull ran after him and fell into step, looking and feeling foolish. Rappaport was a good head taller, and where he was walking, Turnbull was almost running. He shouted above the background noise of the spaceport, "Rappaport, where's Kameon?"<br>Like Turnbull, Rappaport had to raise his voice. "Dead."<br>"Dead? Was it the ship? Rappaport, did the <i>ship</i> kill him?"<br>"No."<br>"Then what? Is his body aboard?"<br>"Turnbull, I don't want to talk about it. No, his body isn't aboard. His--" Rappaport ground the heels of his hands into his eyes, like a man with a blinding headache. "His grave," he said, emphasizing the word, "has a nice black border around it. Let's leave it at that."<br>But they couldn't, of course.<br>Two security officers caught up with them near the edge of the field. "Stop him," said Turnbull, and they each took an arm. Rappaport stopped walking and turned.<br>"Have you forgotten that I'm carrying a destruct capsule?"<br>"What about it?" For the moment Turnbull really didn't understand what he meant.<br>"Any more interference and I'll use it. Understand this, Turnbull. I don't care any more. Project Overcee is over. I don't know where I go from here. The best thing we can do is blow up that ship and stay in our own solar system."<br>"Man, have you gone crazy? What <i>happened</i> out there? You--meet aliens?"<br>"No comment.--No, I'll answer that one. We didn't meet aliens. Now tell your comedian friends to let go."<br>Turnbull let himself realize that the man wasn't bluffing. Rappaport was prepared to commit suicide. Turnbull, the instinctive politician, weighed chances and gambled.<br>"If you haven't decided to talk in twenty-four hours we'll let you go. I promise that. We'll keep you here 'til then, by force if necessary. Just to give you an opportunity to change your mind."<br>Rappaport thought it over. The security men still held his arms, but cautiously now, standing as far back as they could, in case his personal bomb went off.<br>"Seems fair," he said at last, "if you're honest. Sure, I'll wait twenty-four hours."<br>"Good." Turnbull turned to lead the way back to his office. Instead, he merely stared.<br>The <i>Overcee</i> was red hot at the nose, glaring white at the tail. Mechs and techs were running in all directions. As Turn-bull watched, the solar system's first faster-than-light spacecraft slumped and ran in a spreading, glowing pool.<br>* * *<br>...It had started a century ago, when the first ramrobot left the solar system. The interstellar ramscoop robots could make most of their journey at near lightspeed, using a conical electromagnetic field two hundred miles across to scoop hydrogen fuel from interstellar space. But no man had ever ridden a ramrobot. None ever would. The ramscoop magnetic field did horrible things to chordate organisms.<br>Each ramrobot had been programed to report back only if it found a habitable world near the star to which it had been assigned. Twenty-six had been sent out. Three had reported back--so far.<br>...It had started twelve years ago, when a well-known mathematician worked out a theoretical hyperspace over Einsteinian fourspace. He did it in his spare time. He considered the hyperspace a toy, an example of pure mathematics. And when has pure mathematics been anything but good clean fun?<br>...It had started ten years ago, when Ergstrom's brother Carl demonstrated the experimental reality of Ergstrom's toy universe. Within a month the UN had financed Project Overcee, put Winston Turnbull in charge, and set up a school for faster-than-light astronauts. The vast number of applicants was winnowed to ten "hypernauts." Two were Belters; all were experienced spacers. The training began in earnest. It lasted eight years, while Project Overcee built the ship.<br>...It had started a year and a month ago, when two men climbed into the almost luxurious lifesystem of the <i>Overcee</i>, ran the ship out to Neptune's orbit under escort, and vanished.<br>One was back.<br>Now his face was no stonier than Turnbull's. Turnbull had just watched his work of the last ten years melt and run like quicksilver. He was mad clean through; but his mind worked furiously. Part of him, the smaller part, was wondering how he would explain the loss of ten billion dollars worth of ship. The rest was reviewing everything it could remember about Carver Geoffrey Rappaport and William (Wall) Kameon.<br>Turnbull entered his office and went straight to the book-shelf, sure that Rappaport was following. He pulled out a leather-bound volume, did something to the binding and poured two paper cups full of amber fluid. The fluid was bourbon, and it was more than ice cold.<br>Rappaport had seen this bookcase before, yet he wore a faintly puzzled frown as he took a cup. He said, "I didn't think I'd ever anticipate anything again."<br>"The bourbon?"<br>Rappaport didn't answer. His first swallow was a gulp.<br>"Did you destroy your ship?"<br>"Yes. I set the controls so it would only melt. I didn't want anyone hurt."<br>"Commendable. And the overcee motor? You left it in orbit?"<br>"I hard-landed it on the Moon. It's gone."<br>"That's great. Just great. Carver, that ship cost ten billion dollars to build. We can duplicate it for four, I think, because we won't be making any false starts, but you--"<br>"Hell you wouldn't." Rappaport swirled the bourbon in his cup, looking down into the miniature whirlpool. He was twenty to thirty pounds lighter than he had been a year ago. "You build another <i>Overcee</i> and you'll be making one enormous false start. We were wrong, Turnbull. It's not our universe. There's nothing out there for us."<br>"It <i>is</i> our universe." Turnbull let the quiet certainty show in his politician's voice. He needed to start an argument--he needed to get this man to talking. But the certainty was real, and always had been. It was humanity's universe, ready for the taking.<br>Over the rim of his cup Rappaport looked at him in exasperated pity. "Turnbull, can't you take my word for it? It's not our universe, and it's not worth having anyway. What's out there is--" He clamped his mouth shut and turned away in the visitor's chair.<br>Turnbull waited ten seconds to point up the silence. Then he asked, "Did you kill Kameon?"<br>"Kill Wall? You're out of your mind!"<br>"Could you have saved him?"<br>Rappaport froze in the act of turning around. "No," he said. And again, "No. I tried to get him moving, but he wouldn't-- Stop it! Stop needling me. I can walk out anytime, and you couldn't stop me."<br>"It's too late. You've aroused my curiosity. What about Kameon's black-bordered grave?"<br>No answer.<br>"Rappaport, you seem to think that the UN will just take your word and dismantle Project Overcee. There's not a prayer of that. Probability zero. In the last century we've spent tens of billions of dollars on the ramrobots and the <i>Overcee</i>, and now we can rebuild her for four. The only way to stop that is to tell the UN exactly why they shouldn't."<br>Rappaport didn't answer, and Turnbull didn't speak again. He watched Rappaport's cigarette burning unheeded in the ashtray, leaving a strip of charred wet paper. It was uncharacteristic of the former Carver Rappaport to forget burning cigarettes, or to wear an untrimmed beard and sloppily cut hair. That man had been always clean shaven; that man had lined up his shoes at night, every night, even when staggering drunk.<br>Could he have killed Kameon for being sloppy?--and then turned messy himself as he lost his self-respect? Stranger things had happened in the days when it took eight months to reach Mars.--No, Rappaport had not done murder; Turnbull would have bet high on that. And Kameon would have won any fair fight. Newspapermen had nicknamed him The Wall when he was playing guard for the Berlin Nazis.<br>"You're right. Where do I start?"<br>Turnbull was jerked out of his abstraction. "Start at the beginning. When you went into hyperspace."<br>"We had no trouble there. Except with the windows. You shouldn't have put windows on the <i>Overcee</i>."<br>"Why not? What did you see?"<br>"Nothing."<br>"Well, then?"<br>"You ever try to find your blind spot? You put two dots on a piece of paper, maybe an inch apart, and you close one eye, focus on one dot and slowly bring the paper up to your face. At some point the other dot disappears. Looking at the window in overcee is like your blind spot expanding to a two-foot square with rounded corners."<br>"I assume you covered them up."<br>"Sure. Would you believe it, we had trouble finding those windows? When you wanted them they were invisible. We got them covered with blankets. Then every so often we'd catch each other looking under the blankets. It bothered Wall worse than me. We could have made the trip in five months instead of six, but we had to keep coming out for a look around."<br>"Just to be sure the universe was still there."<br>"Right."<br>"But you did reach Sirius."<br>"Yes. We reached Sirius..."<br>* * *<br>Ramrobot #6 had reported from Sirius B, half a century ago. The Sirius stars are an unlikely place to look for habitable worlds, since both stars are blue-white giants. Still, the ram-robots had been programed to test for excessive ultraviolet. Sirius B was worth a look.<br>The ship came out where Sirius was two bright stars. It turned its sharp nose toward the dimmer star and remained motionless for twenty minutes, a silver torpedo shape in a great, ungainly cradle studded with heavy electromagnetic motors. Then it was gone again.<br>Now Sirius B was a searing ball of light. The ship began to swing about, like a hound sniffing the breeze, but slowly, ponderously.<br>"We found four planets," said Rappaport. "Maybe there were more, but we didn't look. Number Four was the one we wanted. It was a cloudy ball about twice the size of Mars, with no moon. We waited until we'd found it before we started celebrating."<br>"Champagne?"<br>"Hah! Cigars and drunk pills. And Wall shaved off his grubby beard. My God, we were glad to be out in space again! Near the end it seemed like those blind spots were growing around the edges of the blankets. We smoked our cigars and sucked our drunk pills and yakked about the broads we'd known. Not that we hadn't done that before. Then we slept it off and went back to work ... "<br>* * *<br>The cloud cover was nearly unbroken. Rappaport moved the telescope a bit at a time, trying to find a break. He found several, but none big enough to show him anything. "I'll try infrared," he said.<br>"Just get us down," Wall said irritably. He was always irritable lately. "I want to get to work."<br>"And I want to be sure we've got a place to land."<br>Carv's job was the ship. He was pilot, astrogator, repairman, and everything but the cook. Wall was the cook. Wall was also the geologist, astrophysicist, biologist, and chemist--the expert on habitable planets, in theory. Each man had been trained nine years for his job, and each had some training as backup man for the other; and in each case the training had been based largely on guesswork.<br>The picture on the scope screen changed from a featureless disk to a patterned ball as Carv switched to infrared. "Now which is water?" he wondered.<br>"The water's brighter on the night side and darker on the day side. See?" Wall was looking over his shoulder. "Looks like about forty percent land. Carv, those clouds might cut out enough of the ultraviolet to let people live in what gets through."<br>"Who'd want to? You couldn't see the stars." Carv turned a knob to raise the magnification.<br>"Hold it right there, Carv. Look at that. There's a white line around the edge of that continent."<br>"Dried salt?"<br>"No. It's warmer than what's around it. And it's just as bright on the night side as on the day."<br>"I'll get us a closer look."<br>* * *<br>The <i>Overcee</i> was in orbit, three hundred miles up. By now the continent with the "hot" border was almost entirely in shadow. Of the three supercontinents, only one showed a white shoreline under infrared.<br>Wall hung at the window, looking down. To Rappaport he looked like a great ape. "Can we do a reentry glide?"<br>"In this ship? The <i>Overcee</i> would come apart like a cheap meteor: We'll have to brake to a full stop above the atmosphere. Want to strap down?"<br>Kameon did, and Carv watched him do it before he went ahead and dropped the overcee motor. <i>I'll be glad to be out of here</i>, he thought. <i>It's getting so Wall and I hate the sight of each other</i>. The casual, uncaring way Kameon fastened his straps jarred his teeth. He knew that Kameon thought he was finicky to the point of psychasthenia.<br>The fusion drive started and built up to one gee. Carv swung the ship around. Only the night side showed below, with the faint blue light of Sirius A shining softly off the cloud cover. Then the edge of dawn came up in torn blue-white cloud. Carv saw an enormous rift in the cloud bank and turned ship to shift their path over it.<br>Mountains and valleys, and a wide river...Patches of wispy cloud shot by, obscuring the view, but they could see down. Suddenly there was a black line, a twisting ribbon of India ink, and beyond that the ocean.<br>Only for a moment the ocean showed, and then the rift jogged east and was gone. But the ocean was an emerald green.<br>Wall's voice was soft with awe. "Carv, there's life in that water."<br>"You sure?"<br>"No. It could be copper salts or something. Carv, we've got to get <i>down</i> there!"<br>"Oh, wait your turn. Did you notice that your hot border is black in visible light?"<br>"Yah. But I can't explain it. Would it be worth our while to turn back after you get the ship slowed?"<br>Carv fingered his neatly trimmed Vandyke. "It'd be night over the whole continent before we got back there. Let's spend a few hours looking at that green ocean."<br>The <i>Overcee</i> went down on her tail, slowly, like a cautious crab. Layer after layer of cloud swallowed he...</p><h2>The Queen&#39;s Houses</h2><p><p><b>Both a sumptuous visual guide and an affectionate look at the personal family stories behind the formal grandeur of the royal residencies</b></p><p>The Queen&#x2019;s life is dedicated to her public&#x2014;every move is scrutinized, every word noted.

A small six inches by nine inches, but over two hundred pages long, with odd illustrations of plants, astrological diagrams, and naked women, it is written in so indecipherable a language and contains so complicated a code that mathematicians, book collectors, linguists, and historians alike have yet to solve the mysteries contained within. However, in <i>The Friar and the Cipher</i>, the acclaimed bibliophiles and historians Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone describe, in fascinating detail, the theory that Roger Bacon, the noted thirteenth-century, pre-Copernican astronomer, was its author and that the perplexing alphabet was written in his hand. Along the way, they explain the many proposed solutions that scholars have put forth and the myriad attempts at labeling the manuscript's content, from Latin or Greek shorthand to Arabic numerals to ancient Ukrainian to a recipe for the elixir of life to good old-fashioned gibberish. As we journey across centuries, languages, and countries, we meet a cast of impassioned characters and case-crackers, including, of course, Bacon, whose own personal scientific contributions, Voynich author or not, were literally and figuratively astronomical.<br><br><i>The Friar and the Cipher</i> is a wonderfully entertaining and historically wide-ranging book that is one part <i>The Code Book</i>, one part <i>Possession</i>, and one part <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>&#x2014;and will appeal to bibliophiles and laypeople alike.</p><p><p>Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone are a husband-and-wife writing team and authors of <i>Out of the Flames</i>, a Booksense 76 Selection. They have also written three books on their book-collecting pursuits: <i>Used and Rare</i>, <i>Slightly Chipped</i>, and <i>Warmly Inscribed</i>.</p>CHAPTER ONE<br><b>Turmoil and Opportunity:<br>Roger Bacon's England</b><br>ROGER BACON WAS BORN IN SOMERSET, in southwest England, about one hundred miles west of London. There are no surviving records of his birth&#x2014;the evidence for the date comes from Bacon himself. In a work known to have been written in 1268 he said: "I have labored much in sciences and languages, and I have up to now devoted forty years to them." What he apparently meant by this was that he had started what today would be the equivalent of an undergraduate arts course in 1228. Since the average thirteenth-century boy started college at about fourteen, this puts the year of his birth at 1214. He lived to be eighty, so his lifetime spanned nearly the whole of the thirteenth century.<br>Bacon came from a family of wealthy minor nobles. His father held no title and was probably a product of the new and burgeoning merchant class, men who worked their way into higher society by accumulating cash, which was then used to purchase land and a manor house. The most successful of these could buy castles and conduct themselves as genuine nobility, knighting their sons, but Bacon's family did not seem to fall into this category. He had at least one older brother, to whom he refers in his writings, but neither was ever granted a title by the king.<br><br>Bacon remained throughout his life a product of the England of his childhood, an England in the midst of great change and rife with civil unrest that would soon erupt into full-scale war. The year after Bacon was born, the hapless King John was forced to sign Magna Carta and thus introduce the first glimmer of representative government into Europe. It was the very weakness of John and, later, his son Henry that created a vacuum into which political, social, educational, and, most significantly, scientific innovation rushed in. The most basic assumptions were challenged, the most fundamental truths rejected. So unfortunate was John as a ruler that he did not need to be known as John I, as no other king in the ensuing eight hundred years of English history was ever given the same name.<br><br>John was the fourth son of the tall, intense, mercurial Henry II, under whose lusty hand the kingdom had grown to encompass not only England but most of France&#x2014;Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Touraine, Toulouse, and, with his marriage to the vivacious, wily Eleanor, the Aquitaine on the Atlantic coast. The official kingdom of France, on the other hand, was limited to Paris and its environs.<br><br>Henry's two eldest sons, Henry and Richard (called Lionheart for his military prowess) were also tall and physically imposing. John was short and unattractive. Richard still referred to John as a child when he was well into his twenties. There was a third older brother, Geoffrey, who was much cleverer than John, although this in itself was not particularly noteworthy.<br><br>With all those older sons, Henry assumed that John was never going to see the English throne, so when the boy was nineteen, he tried to get him a kingdom of his own by sending him off to conquer Ireland. John left with lots of friends, three hundred mercenaries, several barrels of silver pennies with which to pay them, and the promise of a fancy gold crown fitted out with peacock feathers when he won. In no time at all, John and his friends had spent all of the pennies on themselves, causing the mercenaries to desert. He so alienated the Irish nobility that, in a place known for internecine warfare, John managed to get all the aristocrats in Ireland to band together and agree to reject him. Richard, by contrast, had subdued the powerful rebellious barons of southern France by the age of fifteen.<br><br>Richard eventually became king (Henry and Geoffrey died young) but left almost immediately on crusade, where he was captured and held for ransom by the Holy Roman Emperor. As everyone who has ever seen<i> The Adventures of Robin Hood</i> knows, during his absence, John attempted to usurp the English throne by treachery. (In truth, it was Eleanor, not Errol Flynn, who stopped him.) When John heard that his older brother had been freed and was on his way home, he turned tail and headed for France. John was so insignificant in Richard's mind that Richard forgave him and let him come home.<br><br>Just a short time later, however, Richard died while staking out a minor castle for siege. He had disdained armor while parading around the periphery and was shot in the neck with an arrow. The boy whom his father had nicknamed "Lackland" for want of a realm was crowned King John of England at Westminster Abbey on May 25, 1199. Within five years of becoming king, he had lost most of his father's French possessions to the French king, Philip Augustus, earning him a new nickname, "Softsword," among his own nobility.<br><br>Losing to the French turned out to be just the preliminary. In 1205, John, by virtue of an extremely dubious royal edict, found himself taking on the great Pope Innocent III. It was not really a fair fight.<br>Innocent III was one of the seminal figures in the history of the Church. Born into an ancient aristocratic Roman family, he proved a brilliant student in both law and theology. He enjoyed a meteoric rise through the curia and was elevated to the Throne of St. Peter while still in his thirties. Innocent inherited an institution in disarray. In the century preceding his reign, the papacy had sunk to an object of ridicule, ignored by secular monarchs. One of his predecessors had been compelled to ride backward on an ass through the countryside, and another had been obliged to flee Rome disguised as a pilgrim. By a combination of force of personality and the threat of withholding sacraments, Innocent almost single-handedly turned Rome from the political nonentity that it had become into a potent pseudostate, the most important political power in Europe. "By me kings reign and princes decree justice," he observed.<br><br>In 1205, the archbishop of Canterbury died. In Henry II's time, the English bishops would "elect" a new archbishop, although this was in fact a royal appointee. (As usual, Henry had taken custom one step further&#x2014;he had not only assumed the right to elect his own man, Thomas �&#x2020; Becket, as archbishop, but had assumed the right to have him killed as well when Becket disagreed with him.) John naturally expected to have the same privilege as his father, but he bungled the election and Innocent claimed the right of appointment for himself. He chose the highly qualified Stephen Langton, who was at the time teaching at the University of Paris.<br><br>John was outraged at this attempt to usurp his authority and refused to let the new appointee enter the country. So began a war of wills between king and pope. Innocent placed England under interdict, which meant that English priests were forbidden to perform any of the sacraments. Suddenly, no one in England could get married, buried, or baptized. John retaliated by seizing the property of those priests who obeyed Innocent's order. To get it back, they had to swear loyalty to the crown and pay a hefty fee. They even had to pay to get their "housekeepers" (read, mistresses) back. Innocent countered by excommunicating John. The English high clergy packed up and headed to France, and by 1212 there was only one bishop left in all of England.<br><br>Still John refused to yield, so Innocent sent a message to Philip Augustus, the king of France. If Rome deposed John, the excommunicate, would Philip Augustus like to take over in his place? Philip Augustus did, in fact, want to take over England. Langton, who still had not gained entry to the country of which he was nominally the archbishop, was given letters from Innocent announcing that John had been deposed in favor of Philip Augustus. The French massed an army at the Channel.<br><br>John gave up. Langton was accepted as archbishop of Canterbury, and all of the English priests who had fled during the interdict and excommunication were restored to their property and compensated for their damages.<br><br>Philip Augustus, however, had not given up. He had not recalled his army, which was still sitting across the Channel, waiting for the order to invade. John, needing a powerful ally, turned to Innocent. To save himself, John proposed what to many in England was the unthinkable&#x2014;he offered England and Ireland as fiefs of the Church, which also required that he pay a sizable monetary tribute to Rome.<br><br>France attacked anyway and was repulsed when John's subjects, to his and probably their astonishment, rallied to his aid. John, overestimating his position and their loyalty, immediately launched a counterinvasion to reclaim his father's lost territories. His armies were routed.<br><br>The English barons had had enough. A group of them took over London and forced John to put his seal to Magna Carta, or "Great Charter," originally just a remedy for a list of baronial grievances. The key provision, however, which insisted that John obtain approval on matters of state by a board of directors composed of twenty-five of his most rebellious barons, became, albeit unintentionally, a forerunner of English representative government.<br><br>John signed under duress, but he immediately sent messengers to Innocent. Innocent, who was not the type of man to encourage the spreading of power, particularly to twenty-five men who might not do what he said, wrote a strong letter threatening to excommunicate any baron who went against the king and declaring Magna Carta "null and void of all validity forever."<br><br>Uneasy truce then turned into civil war. The rebel barons responded by offering the crown of England to Philip Augustus's son Louis VIII in 1215. Louis came over with an army and secured London. He held the Channel and the east coast of England through the aid of a swashbuckling English pirate with the beguiling name of Eustace the Monk. By 1216, two-thirds of the English barons had come over to Louis. When Innocent died in July of that year, it seemed that John was finished.<br><br>And he was. Three months later, after losing all of his baggage, including his crown, in an ill-fated attempt to cross a river with his army, John consoled himself with "gluttonous consumption of peaches and new cider." He caught dysentery and died, leaving the whole mess to his nine-year-old son, Henry. By the time of Henry's coronation, held in Gloucester, the rebel barons and Louis held the north and east of England, including London, Cambridge, and York, and, thanks to Eustace the Monk, all of the coastal ports in the east except Dover.<br><br>As it turned out, however, Henry's youth was his greatest asset. The sight of this lonely boy crowned in this out-of-the-way spot without the usual pomp and ceremony made Louis appear as someone taking unfair advantage of a child. The English of the south and west rallied. Henry's regents remained loyal and, in a clever move, reissued a revised Magna Carta in Henry's name, called the Charter of Liberties, thus removing the rebel barons' original grievances (and further legitimizing limited representative government). There were defections back to the crown. A battle at Lincoln, won convincingly by the royalists, siphoned off even more of Louis's support. The decisive blow came when the royal fleet sailed windward of Eustace the Monk and, in a daring maneuver, threw powdered lime into the faces of the rebel officers, incapacitating the enemy ships. The Monk's ship was boarded and he was beheaded, and it was all over. Louis sued for peace and was paid seven thousand pounds sterling to get out of England.<br><br>Until Henry III came into his majority in 1227, the government was administered by a group of experienced barons. Every now and then, especially when money was wanted for the royal treasury, the barons would have Henry reaffirm his commitment to the Charter of Liberties, and everybody got used to the idea that the barons had a say in making government policy.<br><br>No Englishman born into this period could miss the lesson of this outcome. It was possible to assail even so fundamental a principle as the divine right of kings and get away with it. With this barrier down, nothing seemed impossible.<br><br>England, separated from the mainland of Europe, provincial, uncultured, and dismissed by the more sophisticated French and Italians, could now question and test old ideas in splendid isolation. With Magna Carta upsetting the traditional political order, the country also became the perfect breeding ground for a new brand of learning, a new approach to the natural world that would spread and eventually threaten the social structure of Europe and the foundations of Christianity.<br><br>No one better embodied the character and spirit of this particularly English movement, or would surface more as both its champion and victim, than Roger Bacon. His parents had ambitions for him, an obviously gifted adolescent. In this new political climate, a talented boy, if educated properly, might advance beyond limitations of rank, perhaps even obtain employment with the king. So when he was fourteen, his parents sent him to school.<br><br>Had he lived even a half century earlier, education would have meant scriptural study at a cathedral school or monastery. But this was 1228, and a new institution had emerged, one that was exerting a great modernizing force over the whole of medieval society. Still in its infancy, it was already drawing away the best students and teachers, the most committed, the most intelligent, the most ambitious. So Roger Bacon's parents sent him off to attend one of these new institutions of learning, called a "university."</p><h2>MYSTERY OF THE MAGIC CIRCLE (The Three Investigators Mystery Series, 27)</h2><p>Three young sleuths uncover a coven of witches when they search for the missing memoirs of a movie star</p><p></p><h2>Knitting Counterpanes: Traditional Coverlet Patterns for Contemporary Knitters</h2><p>Elegant knitted coverings called counterpanes adorned many a bed in the 19th century.

Along the way are entrancing views of many aspects of farm life: the architecture, work and seasonal celebrations as they have evolved over the centuries. Goodall once again shows his remarkable flair for rendering the spirit of a place and era in a single spread. His watercolors capture both particular details and larger impressions, and finely convey a sense of time's inexorable passage. In addition, he makes ingenious use of half-page flaps to portray two faces of a single scene: a harvest dinner becomes a rousing barn dance; haymaking gives way to a midday break in the fields; a milling group of hounds is next shown running with the hunt. As with Goodall's previous works, readers will come away from this book feeling amply enlightened and rewarded. All ages. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 2-4-- Using his trademark half-page inserts to change the dynamics of the larger double-page scenes, the artist studies an English farm from its medieval beginnings to the present day. Brief prefatory notes locate times and places, while each wordless scene, as full, respectful, and believably authentic as Peter Spier's historically set pieces, invites lingering attention. While Jorg Muller, in The Changing City and The Changing Countryside (both Macmillan, 1977), handles a similar theme by focussing on a fixed frame over a shorter time span, here the view shifts to different parts of the farm, both exterior and interior, giving a rounder context. History lives in this companion to Goodall's earlier books.

Holding the prestigious rank of Master of Wine, Robinson lectures and judges all over the world, and recently hosted a ten-part PBS series <em>Jancis Robinson's Wine Course</em>. She also edited <em>The Oxford Companion to Wine</em>, which won every major wine book award in 1995--including the Julia Child Cookbook Award (Wine, Beer, or Spirits) and The James Beard Book Award--and which has been praised by Frank Prial in <em>The New York Times</em> as "easily the most complete compendium of wine knowledge assembled in modern times," and by Anthony Dias Blue as "one of the definitive reference books on the subject."<br> Now, in <em>Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes</em>, Robinson provides wine aficionados with a handy, on-the-spot guide to the most central aspect of wine making--the grapes themselves. Here are over 850 grapes, ranging from such widely acclaimed vines as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Muscat, Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc, to economically important if less distinguished vines such as Airen, Grenache, Muller-Thurgau, Trebbiano, Syrah, and Rkatsiteli. Robinson offers a fact-filled introduction--discussing everything from rootstocks and wine blends, to vine pests and disease--and glossary of technical terms (from botrytis and carbonic maceration, to fanleaf and foxy, to skin, sugars, tannins, and yield). She then examines the world's grape varieties in alphabetical order, describing the basic characteristics of the wine produced by the grape (dry, sweet, high or low acidity, the bouquet), its likely quality, the regions that produce the best wine, and, if a blended wine, the blends that yield the best results. (As an added guide to the wine a grape might produce, the <em>Guide</em> includes an easy-to-use visual aid: a horizontal bar with a band which shows the range of quality, from ordinary to superb.) Robinson also shares much fascinating wine history, her deep insight into the wine industry, and more important, her own judgment on a wine. And Robinson does not hedge in judging a wine: discussing Carignan, France's most planted red wine, she comments "Its wine is high in everything--acidity, tannins, color, bitterness--but flavor and charm. This gives it the double inconvenience of being unsuitable for early consumption yet unworthy of maturation." And for Trebbiano, the most planted white grape in Italy (and with Ugni Blanc, which is the name of the grape in France, the second most planted white grape in the world), Robinson notes "the word Trebbiano in a wine name almost invariably signals something light, white, crisp, and uninspiring." <br> Perhaps most important, this portable book can be used in the store as a buying guide. With Robinson's <em>Guide</em>, simply find the grape variety on the label--or, if not listed, turn to Robinson's unique Grapes Behind the Names appendix in the back--look up the entry on that grape, and you will discover everything you need to know to make an informed decision to buy or pass. With Jancis Robinson by your side, you can evaluate a bottle of wine on the spot, no matter where, when, or by whom it has been produced.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Jancis Robinson</strong> writes a regular column on wine for the <em>Wine Spectator</em>, the world's largest circulation wine magazine, and for <em>The Financial Times</em>.<br></p><h2>First Animal Encyclopedia (Dk First Reference)</h2><p>An inspiring new addition to the First Reference series, the <i>DK First Animal Encyclopedia</i> is loaded with spectacular photographs showing animal habits and habitats.

Famously known as the eighteenth-century French queen whose excesses have become legend, Marie Antoinette was blamed for instigating the French Revolution. But the story of her journey begun as a fourteen-year-old sent from Vienna to marry the future Louis XVI to her courageous defense before she was sent to the guillotine reveals a woman of greater complexity and character than we have previously understood. We stand beside Marie Antoinette and witness the drama of her life as she becomes a scapegoat of the Ancien Regime when her faults were minor in comparison to the punishments inflicted on her.<br>The youngest daughter, fifteenth out of sixteen children, of Austrian empress Maria Teresa and Francis I, Marie Antoinette was sent on a literal journey by her mother from Vienna to Versailles with the expectation that she would further Austrian interests at all times. Yet, Marie Antoinette was by nature far from interested in state affairs and much more inclined to exert a gracious, philanthropic role, patronizing the arts especially music, as royalty would come to behave in the nineteenth century. Despite this the French accused her of political interference and wrote scandalous tracts against her, mocking her lack of sophistication. Meanwhile, longing for a family and the birth of an heir who would have cemented the Franco-Austro alliance, the French queen had to endure more than eight years of public humiliation for her barren marriage before the delivery of her first of four children.<br><br>As these problems unfold, Antonia Fraser also weaves a richly detailed account of Marie Antoinette&#x2019;s other, more poignant journey: from the ill-educated and unprepared girl who sought refuge in pleasure as a consolation into a magnificent, courageous woman who defied her enemies at her trial with consummate intelligence, arousing the admiration of even the most hostile revolutionaries. <br><br>Brilliantly written<i>, </i><b>Marie Antoinette</b><i> </i>is a work of impeccable scholarship. Drawing on a wealth of family letters and other archival materials, Antonia Fraser successfully avoids the hagiography of some the French queen&#x2019;s admirers and the misogyny of many of her critics. The result is an utterly riveting and intensely moving book by one of our finest biographers.</p><p>In the past, Antonia Fraser's bestselling histories and biographies have focused on people and events in her native England, from <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> to <i>Faith and Treason: The Story of the Gunpowder Plot</i>. Now she crosses the Channel to limn the life of France's unhappiest queen, bringing along her gift for fluent storytelling, vivid characterization, and evocative historical background. Marie Antoinette (1755-93) emerges in Fraser's sympathetic portrait as a goodhearted girl woefully undereducated and poorly prepared for the dynastic political intrigues into which she was thrust at age 14, when her mother, Empress Maria Theresa, married her off to the future Louis XVI to further Austria's interests in France. Far from being the licentious monster later depicted by the radicals who sent her to the guillotine at the height of the French Revolution, young Marie Antoinette was quite prudish, as well as thoroughly humiliated by her husband's widely known failure to have complete intercourse with her for seven long years (the gory details were reported to any number of concerned royal parties, including her mother and brother). She compensated by spending lavishly on clothes and palaces, but Fraser points out that this hardly made her unique among 18th-century royalty, and in any case the causes of the Revolution went far beyond one woman's frivolities. The moving final chapters show Marie Antoinette gaining in dignity and courage as the Revolution stripped her of everything, subjected her to horrific brutalities (a mob paraded the head of her closest female friend on a pike below her window), and eventually took her life. Fraser makes no attempt to hide the queen's shortcomings, in particular her poor political skills, but focuses on her personal warmth and noble bearing during her final ordeal. It's another fine piece of popular historical biography to add to Fraser's already impressive bibliography. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>&#x201c;Fascinating . . . the court at Versailles comes alive.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Washington Post<br></i><br>&#x201c;Colorful, fluently narrated. . . .

Reading and writing poetry creates clarity, deepens and expands spiritual inquiry, and cultivates wisdom, compassion, self-confidence, patience, and love. In author Robert McDowell's words, poetry makes you into a tuning fork of the Divine. <br> <br> But poetry has disappeared over the centuries from religious ceremonies, academic curricula, and public discourse. In <i>Poetry as Spiritual Practice,</i> the first inspirational and instructional guide to combine poetry and spirituality, McDowell restores poetry as the natural language of spiritual practice and invites you to recognize poetry as "the pure sound and shape of your spirit." <br> <br> Vividly illustrated with a wide range of poems from all historical eras and poetic traditions, numerous religions and faiths, and McDowell's own and his students' work, <i>Poetry as Spiritual Practice</i> will reintroduce you to the unique pleasure of verse. And meditations throughout will allow you to integrate reading and writing poetry into your spiritual journeys and daily life. <br> <br> Since many of us have long forgotten, or never learned, the mechanics and terminology of poetry -- trochaic feet and tropes trip us up; we can't tell a villanelle from its shorter cousin, rondeau; and a <i>terza rima</i> may as well be a <i>tanka</i> -- this is also an instructional handbook on reading and writing poetry. An engaging guide through the landscape of world poetry, McDowell argues along the way for the many practical benefits of poetic literacy. <br> <br> Making poetry an essential part of daily rituals, aspirations, and intentions will put you on the path to greater meaning, growth, and peace in your life. At once an engaging technical primer, a profound meditation on the relationship between poetry and the Divine, and an inspirational guide for integrating poetry into spiritual practice, <i>Poetry as Spiritual Practice</i> will become a cherished companion.</p><p><b>Robert McDowell's</b> poems, stories, essays, and reviews have appeared in hundreds of magazines and anthologies here and abroad, including <i>Best American Poetry, Poetry, The New Criterion, Sewanee Review,</i> and <i>The Hudson Review.</i> He has taught at Bennington College, the University of Southern Indiana, and UC Santa Cruz; and at the Taos Writers' Conference, among many writers' conferences; and he was founding publisher/editor of Story Line Press.

From there you can work with it. But as you contemplate poetry as spiritual practice, consider, for the next few moments, how and why poetry may have frightened you.</p><p>A few years ago, I chaired a panel at the Northwest Bookfest in Seattle that engaged in a lively discussion with audience members about the perception that poetry turns a cold shoulder toward the general reader, that many who write it seem to be uninterested in communicating to a wide audience. One of the panelists, the poet Thomas Lux, agreed and said, "We have to stop writing poems that make people feel stupid."</p><p>Has poetry ever made you feel stupid? Self-conscious? Have you thought less of yourself in certain company after admitting that you like poetry?</p><p>In practical, earthly terms, what good is poetry? Having confessed that you like it, have your friends accused you of being highfalutin? Did your parents disown you? Did you lose your job or fail in your studies? Did your partner dump you? Did you walk down the street slump-shouldered and blushing while everyone laughed and pointed at you? Probably not. Your fears are almost always scarier, more dramatic, than the actual course you must run.</p><p><b>Exercise: Facing Your Fear<br></b>Before you can break through to a state of centered grace from which the spiritual practice of poetry is possible, you must make a friend of your fears about poetry. You must make your fear a good teacher. Here is a poem about fear, anxiety, and poetry by Cyrus Watson, a twenty-nine-year-old workshop student:</p><blockquote><p><b>Bud &amp; Night Terrors</b></p><p>Can't let them catch me!<br>If my parents find out I'm writing poems<br>They'll cancel Christmas. No Nikes, no Play Station III,<br>No kick-butt pants with twenty miles of chains on them.<br>They'll empty my college fund, certain I'll never be<br>The doctor or lawyer they want me to be. Worse,<br>Coach will kick me off the team, or knock<br>Me down to towel or water boy. My minister will<br>Unbaptize me, my Boy Scout pack will rescind<br>My merit badges, the Marines will get me<br>Though I'm only 17! All because of poetry.<br>What got into me? Why wasn't watching ten hours<br>Of TV a day good enough for me? <i>Why?</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Does this poem sound like something you have thought, like something you might have written once? Make a list of your own poetry fears. Share your list with friends. Discuss where they come from. How do you deal with them? Why should you? Be specific! Write your own poem poking fun at your poetry fear.</p><p><b>Exercise: "It's Alive! It's Alive!" What Is It?</b><br>First, make a list of your own definitions of poetry. Second, seek the opinions of others by asking people you know (spiritual mentor, family, friends, the grocer, the crossing guard, the librarian, your doctor, your coach, your employer, the barista at Starbucks). Meditate on these definitions. Discuss them with friends, which will give you an opportunity to read a friend's heart. What common ground can you discover among people with different spiritual beliefs, education, jobs, reading, and entertainment habits?</p><p><b>Exercise: Personal Pyramid</b><br>Visualization is always useful. Construct a personal pyramid of poetry, a pyramid that presents all of the reasons you've discovered to back up the fact that poetry is important to you. For example, the cornerstones of my personal poetry pyramid are Honesty and Community. From your own cornerstones, erect the pyramid using ten blocks in all, with four blocks as your foundation, three blocks across above it, two blocks in a shelf above that, and one block as your pyramid's tip. For example:</p><p>Intention<br>Character Witness<br>Imagery Spirituality Memory<br>Honesty Music Humor Community</p><p>Because we are all connected, you may use some of my pyramid parts, but you might place them in different positions. That's appropriate. All pyramids are valid, and all of them can change.</p><p>Share your pyramids. They're an opportunity to open up to each other. Discuss what you've learned about listening, truth, and prioritizing your concerns. How have the pyramids under discussion added to your expectations? Your writing and spiritual goals? It's insightful to revisit your pyramids from time to time, for they accurately depict your transformative journey. Tending them reminds you where you've been, where you really are, and where you may wish to go.</p><p><b>Collaborative Exercise: Poetry Pros and Cons</b><br>Team up with a friend and prepare a five-minute dialogue, with one of you taking a position defending poetry as spiritual practice, and one of you taking the opposite view. You could imagine that you are the host of a radio program interviewing your friend. Each of you should come up with three reasons for the point of view you represent. Discuss what you discover through this modeling/rehearsing. Your friend might argue, for example, that poets make things up or even lie; therefore, they are inappropriate spiritual mentors or guides. Or you might argue, as W. H. Auden once did, that poetry, spiritual or otherwise, makes nothing happen. Another argument you might make? Poetry makes us more compassionate.</p><p>Here is a poem by Gretchen Fletcher of Florida about writing poetry:</p><p></p><blockquote><b>Fishing</b><p>It all starts with a line<br>whisked from behind<br>the head, flung far out<br>across the shoulder to hover<br>over a pregnant stream<br>before breaking the surface and sinking,<br>sinking till thumb-stopped<br>and set with a backward crank.<br>Then down there in that black world<br>a midge-sized feather of an idea<br>goes to work, looking,<br>looking for something to use -- <br>some prism-scaled trout, perhaps,<br>that will land flapping at our feet,<br>gasping our air with vermillion gills.<br>Even some ancient algaed boot<br>Will do, home to worms and leeches,<br>tailing long untied strings<br>and strands of water weeds.<br>Then the process starts<br>All over with the casting,<br>casting about for something<br>to write about line after line,<br>to the last line.</p></blockquote><p>In this poem, Fletcher suggests that fishing and writing require supreme patience, a giving in to process. The practitioner must discover satisfaction not so much in the end result, but in the act of doing. This requires faith, and all who have faith are really quite brave, are they not?</p><p>Here is another poem about poetry. This one is by Dori Appel of Ashland, Oregon.</p><p></p><blockquote><b>The Management of Poems</b><p>Sometimes you need to outsmart them -- <br>when they lapse into a silent sulk<br>or become too reasonable or<br>get puffed up with their cleverness.<br>Occasionally, they imagine they've<br>arrived through divine inspiration<br>and sashay through the house<br>embarrassing everyone, or they go on<br>a jag with the family albums,<br>lamenting dead hamsters they never<br>got to say goodbye to, pissing and<br>moaning their old regrets.</p><p>Those are the times to leave them<br>to themselves, and go pull weeds.</p></blockquote><p>In this poem, the author's relationship to the writing of poems seems adversarial, even exasperated. Haven't we all been there? In fact, this poem is itself a metaphor for its author and her obstacles. As in the Fletcher poem, Appel comes to the realization that great patience is needed, but that sometimes the best way to achieve patience (and complete a poem) is to walk away, to rest, regroup, and redirect energy until the inevitable return to the task. This poem is really a lesson in detachment, in letting go.</p><p>Both of these poems, like many other poems about poetry, chronicle a writer's starts and stops. They bear witness to the poem's quicksilver nature, to the writer's frustration and humility. Perhaps most important, they share the <i>experience</i> of making poems and celebrate poetry itself.</p><p>David Chase, the creator and producer of the HBO series <i>The Sopranos</i>, was asked in an interview to describe the formal distinctions between his show and shows on network television.</p><p>"Network television is all talk," Chase said. "I think there should be visuals on a show, some sense of mystery to it, connections that don't add up....There should be, God forgive me, a little bit of poetry."</p><p>David Chase is nearly right. There should be poetry in everything. But not just a little bit. There should be a lot, and there is. There is poetry in every aspect of our daily lives. We worry that poetry is not useful. We fear it is not practical, that it will somehow turn others against us, that it will impede our day-to-day progress. We are afraid that poetry will somehow get in the way of our life plans.</p><p>Yet once we open ourselves anew to poetry, remembering perhaps how sacred poetry defined our earliest moments and experiences, once we retrain our faculties, we discover that we are richer in every way. President John F. Kennedy understood poetry's importance when he wrote, "When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations....The artist...becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society...."</p><p>Once you've neutralized your poetry fears, once you've cleared away your personal obstacles and opened yourself to the promise of a spiritual practice blessed by poetry, you may very well ask yourself, <i>How? How do I proceed?</i> It's an appropriate question at such a life-turning moment, and it may be answered best by considering the processes of some notable writers.</p><p>John Keats, the great English poet who died at age twenty-six in 1821, prepared to write poetry by taking a bath. Afterward, he would dress in his finest clothes, peel and slice an apple, and pour a glass of good red wine.

But the Goodwife of popular historical imagination obscures as much as she reveals; the icon appears to explain early American women's labor history while at the same time allowing it to go unexplained. Tensions of class and gender recede, and the largest artisanal trade open to early American women is obscured in the guise of domesticity.<br><br>In this book, Marla R. Miller illuminates the significance of women's work in the clothing trades of the early Republic. Drawing on diaries, letters, reminiscences, ledgers, and material culture, she explores the contours of working women's lives in rural New England, offering a nuanced view of their varied ranks and roles&#x2015;skilled and unskilled, black and white, artisanal and laboring&#x2015;as producers and consumers, clients and craftswomen, employers and employees. By plumbing hierarchies of power and skill, Miller explains how needlework shaped and reflected the circumstances of real women's lives, at once drawing them together and setting them apart.<br><br>The heart of the book brings into focus the entwined experiences of six women who lived in and around Hadley, Massachusetts, a thriving agricultural village nestled in a bend in the Connecticut River about halfway between the Connecticut and Vermont borders. Miller's examination of their distinct yet overlapping worlds reveals the myriad ways that the circumstances of everyday lives positioned women in relationship to one another, enlarging and limiting opportunities and shaping the trajectories of days, years, and lifetimes in ways both large and small. <i>The Needle's Eye</i> reveals not only how these women thought about their work, but how they thought about their world.</p><p>"This is a wonderful book. It exemplifies prodigious research and unusually creative reading and linking of primary documents. . . . The Needle&#x2019;s Eye is an important addition to New England history, labor history, and women&#x2019;s history. . . . Throughout, the writing is polished, accessible, and filled with the kind of detail that brings a world to life."--Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, Harvard University <p>"Marla Miller&#x2019;s book will inspire similar studies of women&#x2019;s needlework in other regions of the country and, along with Laurel Thatcher Ulrich&#x2019;s The Age of Homespun, be the beginning of a much more thorough understanding of women&#x2019;s early labor history."--Lynne Z. Bassett, The Connecticut Historical Society </p><p>"This is an excellent study of an important topic. . . . It will engage scholars and students in early American history and also be accessible for general readers interested in women&#x2019;s history, material culture, and social life in the period of the American Revolution. . . .

In the conventional narrative of this war, Hitler was defeated by Stalin because, like Napoleon, he underestimated the size and resources of his enemy. In fact, says historian John Mosier, Hitler came very close to winning and lost only because of the intervention of the western Allies. Stalin&#x2019;s great triumph was not winning the war, but establishing the prevailing interpretation of the war. The Great Patriotic War, as it is known in Russia, would eventually prove fatal, setting in motion events that would culminate in the collapse of the Soviet Union.<i>Deathride </i>argues that the Soviet losses in World War II were unsustainable and would eventually have led to defeat. The Soviet Union had only twice the population of Germany at the time, but it was suffering a casualty rate more than two and a half times the German rate. Because Stalin had a notorious habit of imprisoning or killing anyone who brought him bad news (and often their families as well), Soviet battlefield reports were fantasies, and the battle plans Soviet generals developed seldom responded to actual circumstances. In this respect the Soviets waged war as they did everything else: through propaganda rather than actual achievement. What saved Stalin was the Allied decision to open the Mediterranean theater. Once the Allies threatened Italy, Hitler was forced to withdraw his best troops from the eastern front and redeploy them. In addition, the Allies provided heavy vehicles that the Soviets desperately needed and were unable to manufacture themselves. It was not the resources of the Soviet Union that defeated Hitler but the resources of the West. In this provocative revisionist analysis of the war between Hitler and Stalin, Mosier provides a dramatic, vigorous narrative of events as he shows how most previous histories accepted Stalin&#x2019;s lies and distortions to produce a false sense of Soviet triumph. <i>Deathride </i>is the real story of the Eastern Front, fresh and different from what we thought we knew.</p><p>John Mosier is a professor at Loyola Univer-, New Orleans, and author of several previous works of history, including The Myth of the Great War, The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II and Cross of Iron: The Rise and Fall of the German Military Machine.<p><b><b>I<br>INTRODUCTION: <br>PSEUDO-REALITY AND THE SOVIET UNION</b></b> </p><blockquote><p>In appearance everything happens in Russia as elsewhere. There is no difference except at the bottom of things.</p><p>Marquis de Custine, <i>Letters from Russia</i> (1839)1</p></blockquote> <p><b>T</b>he war between Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler was a savage conflict that raged over an enormous battlefront stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. In less than a year and a half, German, Hungarian, and Romanian armies penetrated into the depths of the Russian heartland, reaching historic towns on the Volga and the Don whose last experience of invasion had been centuries before. During the course of the next two and a half years the Red Army retraced that journey in the opposite direction, all the way to the Oder and the Danube, reaching cities whose last experience of Russian soldiery had been almost precisely 140 years earlier, during the Napoleonic Wars. </p><p>The enormous geographic scale of the conflict was more than matched by the savagery of the fighting, the casualties sustained by the combatants, and the appalling level of suffering inflicted on the hapless civilians of European Russia and central Europe, whose peoples had not experienced such a series of calamities since the Thirty Years War. The scale of suffering and ruin was so vast as to be unimaginable. Hitler&#x2019;s wicked and ghastly genocidal campaign against European Jewry is almost submerged in this litany of horror and depravity, even though that genocide was one of his two main goals. </p><p>Hitler&#x2019;s other aim was the destruction of Bolshevism. Our loathing and consternation regarding the Holocaust tends to make us see these two aims as entirely separate. But before the outbreak of the war on September 1, 1939, Hitler&#x2019;s great public relations coup with his fellow Germans and Austrians was to meld the two. Indeed from his public speeches in the 1930s, one could draw the not unreasonable inference that his antipathy toward the Jewish people was largely restricted to those who had espoused Bolshevism.2 </p><p>A consideration of that complex notion lies outside the aims of this book, as does the Holocaust itself. Suffice it to say that to accomplish those two tasks Hitler was willing to see the Third Reich, that mighty state that he had spent decades creating, destroyed. But today the prosperous, peaceful, and culturally rich Jewish communities of Germany, Austria, central Europe, and the Baltic can hardly be said to exist. But neither does the USSR. </p><p>That by the first week of May 1945, Hitler was already dead, his armies destroyed, the cities of what he had intended to be a great imperial realm shattered by American and British bombers, should not lull us into forgetting the astonishing extent to which Hitler&#x2019;s evil empire nearly triumphed. </p><p>Stalin, who planned his own holocaust in secret while basking in the world&#x2019;s admiration as the man who beat Hitler, survived his former ally by barely eight years. By that time, the allegedly victorious citizens of the USSR, no less than those of their client states, were beginning to envy the defeated Germans and Austrians. Hitler had boasted that the empire he created would last a thousand years. The one Stalin had forged collapsed before the millennium. The only enduring legacy of both men is our memory of the mountains of corpses they left behind. </p><p>Given the extent to which Hitler persuaded or tempted the citizens of Austria and Germany, two of the world&#x2019;s most culturally and intellectually advanced nations, into carrying out his nefarious schemes, his infamy, and theirs, naturally preoccupies us. We sometimes forget that Hitler&#x2019;s chief adversary for the greater part of the Second World War was in no way less wicked. When the historical record is examined fairly, the difference between the depravity of the two men is difficult to discern. Most of the perceived differences are a function of Stalin&#x2019;s one unquestionable triumph: the image of himself and of the state he largely created. </p><p>In the decades since his death, the world has slowly come to an understanding of his remarkable success in that endeavor, together with an awareness of his innumerable crimes. There are still die-hard apologists to be found for the man and his system, and not only in Russia, but by and large they are in pretty much the same global circus as Holocaust deniers. </p><p>The sorry history of Stalin&#x2019;s propagandistic triumphs, and its slow unraveling, also lies outside the scope of this book. However, such an understanding is necessary in order to comprehend the reality of the war between the two evil empires. Stalin&#x2019;s great trick was to convince the world that the Red Army had beaten Hitler outright; at that task he succeeded brilliantly. That the state he presided over was, in the words of one economic historian, a &#x201c;victorious loser,&#x201d; is realized either imperfectly or not at all; one frequently has the impression that the collapse of the Soviet state and its main satellites is seen as a natural event, like a tsunami or an earthquake.3 There is a vague realization of general causes and effects, but a rather imperfect understanding of the particulars. </p><p>One very particular cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union was the Second World War. Looking at the wreckage of Berlin in May 1945, comparing it with Moscow, it was easy to believe that Stalin was victorious. Sixty years later, the architecture tells a different story. Both dictators sought out a war that ended in their mutual destruction. Germany&#x2019;s was apparent in May 1945; the Soviet Union&#x2019;s implosion came four and a half decades later. </p><p>That the war destroyed both empires is still poorly understood, masked by the remarkable abilities of Stalin to fool the world into believing that his fantasies were real. He not only built castles in the air, he persuaded people to live in them. Hitler came very close to winning that war, and on the Eastern Front, his soldiers came within an ace of winning outright. In the long retreat back to Berlin and Vienna, they exacted a terrible price on their adversaries. If the astonishing advance of the German army into Ukraine and the Caucasus was, as many of them realized, a deathride, the same must be said about the bloody advance of their opponent. The outcome of the war between the two dictators was a battle to the death for both. </p><p>The aim of this book is to provide the educated general reader with a succinct account of this important conflict, one that places the war within the broader context of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. There are excellent scholarly accounts of almost every aspect of this war. But in addition to being lengthy and technically complex narratives, they lack this broader perspective. The result was described by the classical historian Polybius over 2,000 years ago: </p><blockquote><p>It has always seemed to me that those who believe they can obtain a just and well-proportioned view of history as a whole by reading separate and specialized reports of events, are behaving like a man who, when he has examined the dissected parts of a body which was once alive and beautiful, imagines that he has beheld the living animal in all its grace and movement.4</p></blockquote> <p>The scope of the war and the legends that have surrounded it, when coupled with the unfamiliarity of most readers with the history and geography of central Europe, place a burden on even the most avid reader. But Stalin&#x2019;s war with Hitler presents us with an additional difficulty, one perhaps not contemplated by Polybius: the extent to which one side&#x2019;s account of itself is an elaborate and complex set of falsehoods. </p><p>Indeed, the rise and fall of the USSR is a complex and difficult subject itself, justly deserving of a name (Sovietology). From the very first, the Bolsheviks exerted a polarizing effect on Russians and foreigners alike, producing generations of fierce critics, fanatical apologists, and somewhat bemused analysts who, despite their expertise, seem in retrospect to have been more wrong than right. </p><p>Looking back on their forecasts and predictions in the light of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989&#x2013;1990, one informed analyst noted that the &#x201c;most unlikely scenario had been the one closest to the truth, however unlikely and even absurd it appeared at the time.&#x201d;5 </p><p>Considered in the light of what we now know about both the USSR and the war itself, the evidence suggests not only that Hitler came much closer to an outright victory than is often supposed, but that much of what we think is true about this conflict is, if not completely false, very nearly so. </p><p>Russia has always presented foreigners with difficulties of language and customs as well as geography. Few people could dispute the exactitude of the widely read account of Astolphe-Louis-L�onor, Marquis de Custine, who visited that country in the 1830s, and certainly not the Russians themselves, as the book was banned there for over fifty years. </p><p>A century later, Bolshevik Russia was an even more hermetically sealed and impenetrable state than the Russia of the czars. In most respects people knew less about Russia in 1939 than they did a century earlier, and the situation hardly changed after the end of the Second World War. &#x201c;After forty years in the West, I am still amazed at how little general understanding there is of Soviet reality,&#x201d; the famous concert pianist and conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy observed in 2005.6 </p><p>The marquis was relatively free to move about, which was hardly the case for foreigners after the revolution. He was different in another way as well: &#x201c;I went to Russia to seek arguments for repressive government, I return a partisan of constitutions,&#x201d; he wrote in his Preface.7 The same could not be said of most later visitors. They came not as sharp-eyed observers, but as pilgrims reaching the Promised Land. With few exceptions, they believed anything they were told: &#x201c;We used to run a littl...</p></p><h2>The Unlikely Spy</h2><p>red cloth cover w/gold imprint lettering on spine, yellow, white, red &amp; black dustjacket wt: 860 g, dimen: 24 cm x16 cm x 4.5 cm, 451 pgs</p><p>In this debut novel, veteran journalist Silva mines the reliable territory of World War II espionage to produce a gripping, historically detailed thriller. In early 1944 the Allies were preparing their invasion of Normandy; critical to the invasion&#39;s success was an elaborate set of deceptions--from phony radio signals to bogus airfields and barracks--intended to keep Hitler in the dark about when and where the Allied troops would arrive. Catherine Blake is the beautiful, ruthless spy who could bring the whole charade crashing down; Alfred Vicary is the brilliant but bumbling professor Churchill has tapped to protect the operation. Along with a teeming cast of other characters, real and fictional, they bring the chase to a furious and satisfying climax.Television producer Silva delivers a fine, old-fashioned WW II debut thriller that pits an English don against Admiral Wilhelm Canaris's Abwehr--in a deadly contest of wits on the eve of the Allied invasion of occupied Europe. Recruited for the War Office's MI5 by his friend Winston Churchill, Alfred Vicary (a shrewd history professor who was badly wounded as a behind-the-lines courier during WW I) is assigned early in 1944 to a hush-hush effort to mislead Hitler's intelligence services concerning D-day's primary target. While the bachelor academic employs captured German spies to transmit disinformation to Berlin, radio intercepts confirm that a sleeper agent has been activated to determine where the amphibious assault will come ashore. Despite a discouraging lack of leads, Vicary sets about tracking down the hitherto unsuspected operative (a murderous young woman long established in London under the name Catherine Blake) and the Wehrmacht veteran parachuted in to give her a hand. Dogged police work eventually puts counterespionage watchers on Catherine's trail but not before she beds a susceptible US Navy officer. Aware that the besotted Yank's knowledge could put SHAEF's greatest secret in enemy hands, Vicary coolly blackmails him into cooperating in the ongoing deception. Before he can roll up the network, however, Catherine's alert accomplice verifies that MI5 is on to them. Leaving a slew of bodies in their wake, the two bolt for a U-boat waiting offshore. Although the fugitives are prevented from escaping the British Isles or reporting what they know, Vicary is found wanting by his superiors. Only after Allied forces are marching through France to the Rhineland does Vicary learn that he played a vital role in an endgame more duplicitous than any the department's workaday treacheries had prepared him for. A fine, twisty tale of military intelligence, notable for graceful prose, credibly motivated characters, and evocative detail.

Evans (The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes) makes a fascinating story of its operation, complete with clues to be discovered, internal intrigue, cut-throat politics and lots of local color. He writes with vibrant detail about eccentric criminals such as Abraham Becker and his friend Reuben Norkin who, in 1922, accused each other of murdering Becker's wife-a deed for which both were brought to justice-and a surgeon who killed the patients of his rivals-and who nonetheless was acquitted. Highpoints include the epic battle between Elliot Gross and Michael Baden for the post of Chief Medical Examiner and the thousand-suspect murder of a violinist backstage at Lincoln Center.

It's been even longer since any of his students have shown promise. Enter Angela Argo, a pierced, tattooed student with a rare talent for writing. Angela is just the thing Swenson needs. And, better yet, she wants his help. But, as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions...</p> <p>Deliciously risque, <i>Blue Angel</i> is a withering take on today's academic mores and a scathing tale that vividly shows what can happen when academic politics collides with political correctness.</p></p><p>Francine Prose may never surpass Joyce Carol Oates in the Prolific Olympics, but she is one of those omnipresent writers whom failed writers hate. And surely she'll make new enemies with her hilarious and cruel 10th novel, <i>Blue Angel</i>, a satire of academia, specifically of English and writing departments. The setting is Euston College in rural Vermont, a place kids go to if they don't get into Bennington; a place where desperate novelists teach creative writing to rich kids who don't seem to read. Prose, who has taught at all the hotshot workshops, skewers both teachers and students in the way only a true insider could.<p> Swenson, her writing-teacher protagonist, once published a well-received novel but is now consumed by neuroses and repressed lust, and instead of writing tends to get drunk or morose, or both. But when a gifted student named Angela Argo enters his class, he feels like he is coming back to life. His resurrection into "believing" in writing again, and his eventual disappointment, form the core of the novel.</p><p> Prose's gift for satire is stunning as she directs her caustic wit at all the current academic debates: sexual-harassment policies warning against all manner of "touching"; deconstructionists versus Old School fuddy-duddies; women's studies teachers who bring everything back to the phallocentric Man killing us all. But <i>Blue Angel</i>'s best passages come when the author is describing truly rotten writers. Here's a Connecticut rich girl, a member of Swenson's workshop, who likes to write about all those poor unfortunate nonwhite people. Her story is called "First Kiss--Inner City Blues" and is written from the point of view of a Latino woman who lives in a trash-strewn neighborhood full of gunfire and bad people. Here's the opening line: "The summer heat sat on the hot city street, making it hard for it to breathe, especially for Lydia Sanchez." It's a sentence so bad, it's almost a revelation. <i>--Emily White</i></p><p>It has been years since Swenson, a professor of creative writing at a small New England college, has published a novel of his own. It's been even longer since a student of his has shown a glimmer of talent. And academia, with its increasingly stifling politically correct environment, isn't what it used to be. Enter Angela Argo, a pierced, tattooed student with a rare gift for writing. Fearless and ambitious, Angela seems like the answer to Swenson's prayers. Better yet, she wants his help.

I decided on the simplest approach possible. I would ask a few of the astronauts and find out - The men had it. Yeager. Conrad. Grissom. Glenn. Heroes. The first Americans in space - battling the Russians for control of the heavens, putting their lives on the line. The women had it. While Mr Wonderful was aloft, it tore your heart out that the Hero&#39;s Wife, down on the ground, had to perform with the whole world watching. &#34;The Right Stuff&#34;. It&#39;s the quality beyond bravery, beyond courage.</p><p>Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. "<i>The Right Stuff</i>," he explains, "became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero." <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his "characters" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Kids &#39;N&#39; Clay Ceramics Book</h2><p>It&#39;s a fact: most kids love mucking around with clay.

Mailer breathes life into the figures of that era; the eighteenth dynasty Pharaoh Rameses and his wife, Queen Nefertiti; Menenhetet, their creature, lover and victim; and the gods and mortals that surround them in intimate and telepathic communion. His hero, three times reincarnated during the novel, moves in the bright sunlight of white temples, in the exquisite gardens of the royal harem, along the majestic flow of the Nile and in the terrifying clash of battle. An outstanding work of creative imagination, Ancient Evenings displays Mailer&#39;s obsession with magic, violence and eroticism and lives on in the mind long after the last page has been turned.</p><p>Born in Long Branch, NJ, in 1923, and raised in Brooklyn, Norman Mailer was one of the most influential writers of the second half of the 20th century and a leading public intellectual for nearly sixty years. He is the author of more than thirty books. The Castle in the Forest, his last novel, was his eleventh New York Times bestseller. His first novel, The Naked and the Dead, has never gone out of print. His 1968 nonfiction narrative, The Armies of the Night, won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. He won a second Pulitzer for The Executioner&#x2019;s Song and is the only person to have won Pulitzers in both fiction and nonfiction. Five of his books were nominated for National Book Awards, and he won a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation in 2005. Mr. Mailer died in 2007 in New York City.One<br><br>The darkness was deep. Yet I had no doubt. I was in an underground chamber ten paces in length by half in width, and I even knew (just as quickly as a bat) that the room was all but empty. Stone was the surface of the walls and the floor. As if I could see with my fingers, I had only to wave an arm to feel the size of the space beyond my reach. It was exactly so remarkable as to hear voices by the hairs of one&#x2019;s nose. For that matter, I could smell the scent of stone. Say that an absence was in the air, some hollow that dwelt within another hollow. Now I was aware of a granite coffer near to me, as aware, indeed, of its presence as if my body had walked within&#x2014;it was huge enough to be my bed! But a step away, as if on guard, were some aged droppings on the floor, pellets from a small fierce animal who had managed like myself to find its way here, and left its deposit and gone. For there was no skeleton to speak of the beast. Just the scent of some old urine-�cursed� dung&#x2014; But where was the passage by which the animal could have entered? I breathed in the horror that comes when the air is close with an animal&#x2019;s mean excrement. That has its own message to give!<br><br>Yet, I could also recognize a pure bouquet of fresh night air that had chosen to enter this chamber. Had it come from a shaft in the rock used by the cat?<br><br>In the dark, between two blocks of stone, my fingers soon found a niche not much greater in width than a man&#x2019;s head. Still, by its fresh breath, it must lead outside. The air that arrived through the shaft was only a whisper, not strong enough to stir one hair on a feather, but it offered the cool of the desert when the sun has been down for much of the night. Toward that cool murmur, I stretched, and to my surprise was able to follow my arm up the niche. It was a long shaft between great blocks of stone, and in places seemed no wider than my head, but it went in a straight line at a steep angle upward, a filthy trip. The dead shells of countless beetles cluttered my way. Ants went by my skin. Rats piped in high terror. Still, I climbed with no panic, only in surprise at the narrow dimensions of this passage. Surely I was not able to make my way through&#x2014;it was hardly larger than the burrow of a snake&#x2014;yet I might as well have been without shoulders or hips. Cunning was in my touch as if, like a snake, there was no fear of being caught in the passage ahead. I was capable of becoming narrower. But that is no better than to say I traveled with my thoughts through the long narrow shaft, my body sufficiently supple to obey&#x2014;a most peculiar sensation. I felt altogether alive. The whisper of the air before me had phosphorescence. Particles of light glowed in my nose and throat. I was more alive than I could ever remember and yet felt no yoke of muscle and bone. It was as if I had been reduced to the size of a small boy.<br><br>When I lay at last near the mouth of the passage, my view was of the sky at the end of the shaft and moonlight slanted over the edge. As I rested, the moon passed full into view and anointed me. From orchards in the distance came a scent of date and fig trees, and the clear refreshment of the vines. The air on this night gave intimations to me of gardens where once I made love. I knew again the smell of rose and jasmine. Far below, by the riverbank, the palms by the shore would be black in outline against the silver water of the river.<br><br>So I came out at last from the end of the shaft in that great hill of stone. I stuck my head and shoulders into the open night, pulled through my legs, and gasped. Beneath the light of the moon was a long white slope of stone with the earth far below, but out there on the plateau of the desert, mute as a mountain of silver, there at the end of my gaze, was a Pyramid. Beyond it, another. Nearer to me, all but covered in sand, was a stone lion with the head of a man. I was perched on the slope of the Great Pyramid! I had just been&#x2014;it could be nowhere else&#x2014;in the burial chamber of the Pharaoh Khufu.<br><br>Harsh as the sound of a man&#x2019;s snore was the name of Khufu. He was gone a thousand years, and more. Yet, at the thought of having been in His tomb, my body was too weak to move. The sarcophagus of Khufu had been empty. His tomb had been found and robbed!<br><br>I thought my heart would strike its last sound. My stomach had never felt so pure a slop of cowardice. Yet I was a man of valor, as I seemed to remember, perhaps a soldier, renowned for something&#x2014;so, I could swear&#x2014;all the same, I could not move a step. In shame I shivered beneath the moon. There I was, on the slope of our greatest Pyramid, moonlight on my head and heart, the statue of the immense lion below, and the Pyramids of the Pharaoh Khaef-�ra� and the Pha�raoh Men-�kau-�ra to the south. To the east, I saw the moon on the Nile and far to the south, I even saw the last of the lights in the lamps of Memphi where mistresses were waiting for me. Or were they waiting for another by now? I was so reduced as to think it did not matter. Had I ever had a thought like this before?&#x2014;I, whose first fear used to be that I was too ready to kill any man who looked at my woman? How exhausted I felt. Was this the price I paid for entering the tomb of Khufu? In gloom, I began to make my way down, sliding from crack to crack in the limestone, and knew some foul change had taken place in me already. My memory, which had given every promise (in the first glow of moonlight) that it would return, was still a sludge. Now the air was heavy with the odor of mud. That was the aroma of these lands, mud and barley, sweat and husbandry. By noon tomorrow, the riverbank would be an oven of moldering reeds. Domestic animals would leave their gifts on the mud of the bank&#x2014;sheep and pigs, goats, asses, oxen, dogs and cats, even the foul odor of the goose, a filthy bird. I thought of tombs, and of friends in tombs. Like the plucking of a heavy string came a first intimation of sorrow.<br><br>Two<br><br>I was in the most peculiar situation. I still did not know who I was, nor how old I might be. Was I mature and powerful, or young and in the beginning of my strength? It hardly seemed to matter. I shrugged, and began to walk, taking, for whatever reason, a path through the Necropolis, and as I meandered, I began to explain to myself what I saw, or so I would put it, for I felt in the oddest position, and like a stranger to my own everyday knowledge.<br><br>Before me, I must say, was no more to see than the straight streets of this cemetery in the moonlight, a view without great charm, unless there is charm to be found in high value. Cubit for cubit, the city of the dead had the dearest plots in all of Memphi, or at least that is what I certainly remember.<br><br>Wandering down the alleys of our monotonous Necropolis, sauntering past the shuttered door of one tomb, then another, I began&#x2014;for no reason I could give&#x2014;to think of a friend who had died recently, the dearest of my friends, this memory seemed to say, and the most absurd and violent death. Now, I had no more than to wonder whether his tomb was anywhere near about, and was visited with more recollections. My friend, I was ready to think, came from a powerful family. His father, if I could recall, had once served as Overseer of the Cosmetic Box&#x2014;I would die, I thought, before lusting after such titles myself. Still, that was not a career to be sneered at altogether. Our Ramses, if I remembered correctly, was as vain as a beautiful girl, and detested any flaw in His appearance.<br><br>Of course, with such a father, my friend (whose name, I fear, still eluded me) was certainly wealthy and noble. Poor entombed bugger! He must be, at the least, a descendant of the great Ramses, yes, the one, I could recall, who died something like a hundred years ago, our own Ramses the Second. He had ended as a very old man with a great many wives and more than a hundred recorded sons and fifty daughters. They produced ancestors in such numbers that today you cannot begin to estimate how many officers and priests are Ramessides by at least half of their line. For truth, hardly a rich woman in Memphi or Thebes will fail to offer one bona-�fide� cheek of her buttocks, royal as the Pharaohs, and she will not fail to let you know. To be descended from Ramses the Second may not be exceptional, but it is �indispensable&#x2014;at least if she wants a family plot in the Necropolis. Then, she had better be, at least by half, a Ramesside. In fact, you cannot even buy a tomb in the Western Shade if you are not, and that is only the first requirement in such commerce among Memphi matrons. There are not enough plots. So they go to great lengths. For instance, the mother of my dead friend, the matron Hathfertiti, was always prepared to trade. If the price was good enough, the sarcophagus of an ancestor could be transferred to an inferior tomb, or even shipped downriver to another necropolis. Of course one had to ask: Who was the deceased? How substantial was his curse? That was the unspoken part of the transaction&#x2014;you had to be ready to take on a few malevolent oaths. But some were ready to welcome them if they were terrible enough to bring the price down. For example, Hathfertiti had been bold enough to sell the tomb of her dead grandfather. Concerning this dead relative, her husband&#x2019;s grandfather (who happened incidentally to be her own grandfather since she was certainly her husband&#x2019;s sister) it was told to the buyer that old man Menenhetet had been the kindest and most benign of men. His vice was that he could not harm his enemies. His curse need hardly be feared. What torture of the truth! In secret, it was whispered that Menenhetet had been known to eat fried scorpions with bat dung&#x2014;just so great was his need to protect himself against the curses of the powerful. He had had a mighty life, I seemed to remember.</p><h2>Miracle and Power of Blessing</h2><p>A wonderful story of a young man and an older women.

Many readers will be amused when Rosenberg bares her sweet-toothed soul, telling how she devised her "Yin and Yang of calorie consciousness": while living on "a strict diet of brown bread, cheese, fruit, nuts,sic and vegetables," she would think nothing of polishing "the meal off with a fat slab of cheesecake." But despite a smattering of recipes with truly novel twists (e.g., mustard gingerbread), much here will be found in other cookbooks.

In the predawn light his features were unclear. He was simply a presence of darker blue than the sky behind him. But there was about him a scent of woody smoke and new leaves and the honey of far-off, unseen flowers. The presence pointed at Tendai and said, "You!"</p><p>The boy woke up at once. The first rays of dawn were sliding over the garden wall, and the window was empty. What a strange dream, thought Tendai. He pulled the sheet over his head as he tried to remember it better. The image faded away, leaving a strange sense that something important was about to happen. His ancestors must have felt this way before a big hunt.</p><p>Tendai imagined them lying on the warm earth of their huts, feeling it tremble with destiny. Their shields and spears lay ready by the door. Not like me, he thought. He snuggled into a soft bed in one of the finest mansions in Zimbabwe. Around the house were a large garden and a wall studded with searchlights and alarms. The automatic Doberman growled as it made a last tour of the lawn before retiring to its kennel.</p><p>Any tremble of destiny would have had to struggle through the concrete foundations of the house. It would have had to work through inlaid wooden floors and thick carpets, to creep up the grand staircase to the second floor. Only a whisper could have found its way to his waiting ear.</p><p>Yet find him it did.</p><p>He heard the robot gardeners clipping the grass along a walk. Hoopoes called from jacaranda trees, but a microchip went on with a far better selection of birdsong. It was certainly beautiful, but Tendai felt a pang of regret at not being able to hear the real birds. The mynah &#x2013; a living creature smuggled in by the Mellower &#x2013; stirred in its cage. "Mangwanani," it said. "Have you slept well?"</p><p>Kuda, Tendai's little brother, sat up and answered, "I have done so if you have done so."</p><p>The mynah paid no attention to this polite reply. "Mangawani! Mangawani!" it shrieked, rattling the door of its cage.</p><p>Kuda hopped out of bed and released the bird. It fluttered to a table and snapped up a crust of bread from last night's supper. Tendai could hear the crumbs showering over his books. He pulled the covers more tightly around his ears to keep in the light, happy feeling of excitement.</p><p>A house robor purred as it went from door to door with tea. It entered and placed two steaming cups on the table. The mynah squawked as it was pushed aside. "Good morning," said the robot. "It's September second, 2194. The time is six-fifteen A.M. Breakfast is at seven. Be on time if you know what's good for you."</p><p>"Go away," muttered Kuda as he blew on the hot tea.</p><p>"Anyone who oversleeps is a big fat booboo head," retorted the robot as it glided out.</p><p>"Rita programmed it to say that," Tendai said as he threw back the covers.</p><p>"I know. Well, are you going to ask him?" Kuda swung his short legs off the edge of his chair.</p><p>"I'm not promising anything."</p><p>"You're a wimp."</p><p>Tendai didn't bother to argue. Kuda didn't know how difficult it was to ask Father anything. That duty fell on the eldest brother. Besides, when Kuda got an idea in his head, it took an earthquake to dislodge it. "I had the funniest dream this morning," Tendai began.</p><p>"The mynah just knocked over your tea," Kuda remarked. Tendai grabbed a towel and cleaned up the mess. Then he quickly took a shower and dressed in his Scout uniform. Breakfast was at seven, not a minute earlier or later.</p><p>The two brothers stood outside the dining room door, where they were joined by Rita. She was also in a Scout uniform. A hundred years before, Boy and Girl Scouts had belonged to different organizations, but now they were lumped together. Father approved of them because they taught the virtues most revered by the people of Zimbabwe: loyalty, bravery, courteousness and reverence for Mwari, the supreme god.</p><p>Kuda had no Scout uniform because he was only four. He did his best with a sand-colored shirt and a pair of shorts. "Breakfast!" chimed the door as it swung open. The children trooped in. They lined up in order with Tendai, age thirteen, first and Rita, eleven, second. Tendai was secretly embarrassed that he and Rita were the same height. Kuda was last.</p><p>Mother smiled at them from her chair. She looked cool and elegant in her long white dress. She toyed with a slice of cantaloupe on a blue plate.</p><p>"All present and accounted for," said Father. "Rita, stop slouching." The children stood as tall as they could manage as their father marched from his great chair at the head of the table. He wore a general's uniform with gold braid on his massive shoulders. His chest was covered with medals. Since it was breakfast and he was home and it was a warm day, he left his cap on a hat rack.</p><p>"Shirttail out, Kuda. Five push-ups for you. Rita, pull in your stomach. You are not a watermelon. Tendai-" Father stopped, and Tendai felt sweat prickle on his forehead. He loved his father, but sometimes he wished he wasn't so &#x2013; so military. He suspected Father would like to have Mother at the end of the line, tall and perfectly groomed. But even Father could hardly order her to do push-ups if he detected a loose thread.</p><p>"Tendai passes inspection," said Father, and he stalked back to his chair. Tendai relaxed, not letting it show. Passing inspection was as close as Father ever got to praise. Perhaps he could ask the question after all.</p><p>They were allowed to sit down, but things began to go wrong at once. The maid robot spooned porrideg on the tablecloth. She had to be sent to the kitchen for readjustment. The butler took over the serving. He wouldn't give Rita extra sugar, and she sulked. The holophone trotted up to Father's chair and clamored until he answered it.</p><p>A report began to feed in: pictures of fire engines and ambulances flashed across the screen. Tendai watched idly because he had nothing better to do. The Masks, the only ganag remaining after Father's war on crime, had set off a bomb in a shopping center. Bodies were taken out of the smoking ruins. Statistics rattled across the bottom of the screen. Tendai turned away. It was all remote, of no interest.</p><p>"Accursed Masks!" shouted Father at the holophone. "Get me the police chief!" The phone bobbed and dialed. Father and the police chief made plans while the omelets on everyone's plates got cold.</p><p>Of course no one thought of eating until Father was ready. He was an elder and head of the family.</p><p>"Lizard eggs," muttered Rita, poking at her omelet.</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t start," Tendai said in a low voice.</p><p>"Chickens are descended from reptiles. I read it in a book."</p><p>"Be quiet."</p><p>"Nasty old cold lizard eggs."</p><p>"Is something wrong?" thundered Father from the head of the table.</p><p>"No," said Tendai, Rita and Kuda all together.</p><p>"Everything's delicious," added Rita. "Especially the eggs."</p><p>"Is it too much to ask," shouted Father, "when I'm trying to protect ten million citizens from packs of hyenas that want to tear down our civilization, <i>is it too much to ask for a little peace and quiet at the breakfast table</i>&gt;" He slammed the receiver down. The holophone whimpered and cowered against a wall.</p><p>Everyone ate in silence. Tendai had a mental picture of his father lining up everyone in the city. "Ten push-ups for you, twenty for you," he would growl as he inspected a line of ten million people. Tendai had to clench his jaws to keep from laughing.</p><p>"What's this?" said Father as the butler robot placed a rack of dry toast by his plate.</p><p>"No butter until your blood pressure goes down. Doctor's orders," the butler said.</p><p>"I hate dry toast." But Father piled it with blackberry jam and ate it anyway.</p><p>Tendai listened to the birdsong in the garden. He couldn't ask about the Scout trip now. They were going to spend another long, boring day locked up in the house. All because Father was afraid they would get kidnapped.</p><p>"It's time for the Mellower," said Mother in her gentle voice. Everyone looked up, even Father, although he pretended he was only checking the time. The butler robot cleared away the dishes. They sat expectantly, watching the door.</p><p>"He's late," said Mother.</p><p>"He's always late," said Father.</p><p>Tendai felt a disloyal twinge of pleasure. The Mellower was the one person Father couldn't organize. The Mellower had smudges on his shoes. Buttons dropped off his shirt and were forgotten. His lunches lasted three hours, and he made paper airplanes of the homework he was supposed to supervise. Tendai, Rita and Kuda often covered up for him.</p><p>"I'll send the butler after him," sighed Mother.</p><p>"If he were one of my soldiers, I'd order him to do fifty push-ups," Father said. "No, a hundred."</p><p>The sprinklers in the garden switched on; the odor of wet dust drifted through the window. It made Tendai think of the storms that blew out of the Indian Ocean. He thought of the faces of his ancestors turned toward the sky. They smiled as the rain opened the earth. They sang praises to Mwari, whose voice is thunder, and to mhondoro, the spirit of the land&#x2014;</p><p>"Wake up," whispered Rita, kicking him under the table. Tendai straightened just as Father looked at his end of the table.</p><p>"It <i>can't</i> be seven-thirty," came the Mellower's voice from down the hall. "I'm sure I set the alarm. Oh, dear, I'm such a bad boy." He hurried through the door and brushed a mop of blond hair from his pale forehead.</p><p>"What wonderful, patient people...</p></p><h2>Mystics, Masters, Saints, and Sages: Stories of Enlightenment</h2><p>Organized chronologically, starting with Buddha and ending with contemporary seekers, this book focuses on the moment of enlightenment in the lives of saints and masters that led to their witnessing divine reality.</p><p>All the figures profiled in <i>Mystics, Masters, Saints, and Sages</i> have one experience in common: they achieved enlightenment, the elusive promise of "profound peace, extreme happiness, and a deep understanding of the truth," as editors Robert Ullman and Judith Reichenberg-Ullman describe it. In gathering the autobiographical stories, essays, and poems written by these various seekers, the editors explore diverse pathways to transcendence. Some, such as the Buddha, suffered. Others found the right guide, such as the Sufi poet Rumi, who met his beloved teacher in a bustling Turkish marketplace. Some went to the brink of suicide, such as the Canadian Eckhart Tolle, author of <i>The Power of Now</i>. The editors offer a brief biographical sketch before each essay, giving readers context for digesting these inspiring experience, which span thousands of years and many regions of the world. The editors claim to be nondenominational, but there are significantly more contributions from Eastern traditions than any other. <i>-- Gail Hudson</i>Mystics, masters, saints and sages appear in every major world religion and mystical tradition, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Sufism, and the Baha'i faith, as well as in lesser known religions and individual spiritual paths. Whether saints and sages refer to the Beloved, the Divine Mother, Christ, Yahweh, Shiva, Allah, the One, the Self, Emptiness, or Consciousness makes no difference. The paths are many, the mountain is one. <p></p><p>Although mystics and masters can help us, inspire us, teach us and show us the way, each of us must ultimately walk on our individual path to God. These great spiritual teachers have achieved that which is desired, but eludes, the vast majority of human beings: divine love, universal compassion, profound peace, timeless wisdom, abiding Presence, sublime happiness and a deep understanding of Truth. They have expanded their individual consciousness to embrace the infinite and cosmic aspects of life. By the examples of the saints and sages, as told in each of their stories, and through your own study, meditation, prayer, love, devotion and service, may you be made aware of the immortal Soul or Self in all beings and every thing, May these stories bless you on your journey to realize God and your own Self.</p></p><h2>The Hunt for Red October</h2><p>The runaway international No 1 bestseller that launched Tom Clancy&#39;s spectacular career and introduced his acclaimed hero, Jack Ryan, in the ultimate submarine adventure -- now reissued with a new cover.

The upkeep of her historical childhood home, Provender House, in the depths of the English countryside, is indeed a constant daily battle for this modern-day princess. Princess Olga Romanoff, is the daughter of the eldest nephew of Tsar Nicholas II, murdered with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918. She is the youngest child of the late Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia, who was born in the Winter Palace in St Petersburg in 1897. He fled Russia in 1918 with his pregnant (first) wife and his father, Grand Duke Alexander Michaelovich, while his mother, Grand Duchess Xenia, and his grandmother, Her Imperial Highness Maria Feodorovna, followed a few months later. The fabled Romanov jewels that they were able to smuggle out had to be sold and the exiled family were accommodated for some time by the British Royal Family at various grace-and-favour homes at Windsor Castle and Hampton Court. The book is peppered with amusing anecdotes about the British Royal Family, their British cousins. The reader will also get a glimpse of the Princess's cosseted childhood. She was looked after by a number of nannies and then privately educated at home, as her mother remembered the terrible time she herself had had at boarding school. But Princess Olga preferred the outdoor life and riding her ponies. She still laughs at one of her mother's ambitions which was to marry her off to Prince Charles! It was indeed an unusual upbringing with a snobbish and strict mother of Scottish and Scandinavian background, and a more relaxed and indulgent Romanov father whose occupation was stated as 'Prince of Russia' on Olga's birth certificate. Her home, Provender House is crammed full of fascinating Romanov memorabilia, from the crockery used by the tsar and his family during their final captivity in Ekaterinburg, to the diamond blade penknife used for scratching&nbsp;ContentsCast of Main Characters; List of Illustrations; 1 The Romanov Legacy; 2 My Mother's Family; 3 Nursery Days; 4 Wild in Kent; 5 Out into Society; 6 Highland Fling; 7 Provender; 8 My Children; 9 Provender Deteriorates; 10 Restoration; 11 Lost Heritage; 12 Reflections</p><p><b>Coryne Hall </b>is the author of <i>Little Mother of Russia</i>, a biography of Princess Olga's great-grandmother, and co-author of Once a Grand Duchess: Xenia, Sister of Nicholas II, a biography of Princess Olga's grandmother.

After a long ordeal, she not only succeeds, but surrenders to a passion the likes of which she's never known. But the lovers' happiness is short lived, for Bao is entangled in a complication that soon leads to their betrayal.</p><p>Jacqueline Carey's previous publications include various short stories, essays, a nonfiction book, <em>Angels: Celestial Spirits in Legend and Art</em>, as well as the nationally bestselling series Kushiel's Legacy.Still chasing her destiny in the sequel to Naamah's Kiss (2009), Moirin follows the urging of her diadh-anam across Tatar territory, looking for Bao, her Ch'in lover, who holds the other half of her divine soul-spark. She finds him married to the Great Khan's daughter, and their plans to smooth this wrinkle go disastrously wrong when the Great Khan arranges to have Moirin kidnapped by fanatical, pious Vralians, while Bao is led into the lands of the Spider Queen. Though this book is packed with new people, new lands, and new gods, the pacing is slow and the tone reflective. Carey's involving depictions of several religions also grow rather pointed. While Bao is never present long enough to gain depth, Moirin grows in strength and compassion, confronting several interesting crossroads in her faith and her way of life. Despite a &#x201c;middle book&#x201d; feel, series fans will love it, and an ominous warning about Raphael de Merliot, whom Moirin must &#x201c;reckon with,&#x201d; gives us something to look forward to in the next book. --Krista Hutley</p><h2>INTRODUCTION TO COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA</h2><p>Slight damage at bottom of cover at the spine; Westview Press hardcover copy.

In Caring Lessons, Lois Roelofs tells her stories about being a rebellious minister&#39;s daughter, reluctant nurse, restless mom, perpetual student, and eventually, fun-loving teacher. She used to tell her students that if she, an ordinary suburban sandbox mom, propelled by restlessness and prayer, could end up having a career, growing in faith, and getting a PhD, they could too. Roelofs brings the &#34;therapeutic use of self&#34; required in nursing to her writing. You will be amused, saddened, and inspired as you read this intimate and introspective memoir. You may even run to enroll or teach in a nursing program, and, if you&#39;re already teaching nursing students, you may discover renewed gratitude for the privilege. The main theme of the book is caring-caring for others and caring for oneself. The &#34;others&#34; in Roelofs&#39; career involved students as well as patients: students in the classroom, clinical settings, and her office and patients in inpatient as well as in a variety of outpatient settings. In caring for others, the nurse as caregiver must care for herself; she did so by changing jobs to suit her interests, going back to school more than once to feed her crave for learning, and seeking professional help when first her restlessness as an unhappy housewife and much later, illnesses of several people close to her and her husband&#39;s cancer invaded her personal life. The idea for writing Caring Lesson came while Roelofs in Chicago was talking to a nursing friend in North Carolina. They were nearing retirement, wondering what they would do with their time, when the subject of writing their nursing stories popped up. They both had a passion for their profession and felt people need to know more about nurses. What do they do? How do they think? How do they choose where to work and what kind of work they do? And because she couldn&#39;t find any memoirs written by nursing professors describing their personal and professional lives, she felt she could reach out to others with her story. Readers will learn the importance of faith, family, and friendship that applies to their own lives whatever their profession and will come away with a new appreciation of caring for themselves as well as caring for others.</p><p>Lois Roelofs is Professor Emerita of Nursing at Trinity Christian College. Her new passion is writing and reading creative nonfiction.</p><h2>Pride and prejudice</h2><p>Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th-century England. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. Though the story is set at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of &#39;most loved books&#39; such as The Big Read.[1] It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen&#39;s memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies worldwide.[2] As Anna Quindlen wrote, &#34;Pride and Prejudice i</p><p></p><h2>Lion in the Valley</h2><p>Amelia Peabody, the intrepid Egyptologist, returns to the Nile with her sexy archaeologist husband Emerson and their entourage to track down a brilliant and dashing master criminal wreaking havoc among the excavations</p><p><p> Elizabeth Peters earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago's famed Oriental Institute.

Spanning what was once Canada and the U.S., the British Isles and Australia, the semifeudal Yukon empire has a near monopoly on nonelectrical technology. Readers have two windows into this unsettling future: Sir Robert Mayfair Bruce, the book's main narrator and protagonist, and Dr. Professor Roland Modesty Van Buren, the historian who presents and annotates the 50th anniversary edition of Bruce's controversial memoirs. These memoirs detail Bruce's involvement in the brutal Four Points War and his relationship with the man who launched it, Isaac Prophet Fitzpatrick, who has been immortalized as a hero of Yukon society. Judson's use of the twin viewpoints allows him to make points about subjects as diverse as history and heroes, academia and ambition, love and shame. Yet like Heinlein, Asimov and other great writers in the genre, Judson never lets his message get in the way of the story, nor does he lapse into preachiness. This terrific SF debut is sure to be a contender for many awards. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cramer debunks the myths and takes readers along a winding historical trail full of surprising revelations and riveting anecdotes, explaining the roots of America&#39;s gun culture.</p><p><strong>Clayton E. Cramer</strong> has an MA in History from Sonoma State University, and has taught history at Boise State University and George Fox University (Boise branch). A writer whose work has been published in the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, <em>National Review</em>, and the <em>American Rifleman</em>, he has published several academic books on history and firearms, including <em>For the Defense of Themselves</em> <em>and the State</em> and <em>Black Demographic Data, 1790-1860</em>. He writes a monthly column for <em>Shotgun News</em> (circ. 95,000).<br>Cramer, an adjunct lecturer in history at Boise State University and George Fox University, took on Michael Bellesiles even before his book <i>Arming America </i>was discredited, and now goes further to prove wrong Bellesiles's claim that guns were uncommon in early America. Cramer finds that guns "were the norm" in that period, people relied on guns to hunt, and gun ownership was key to the success of colonial militias. His most intriguing argument is that, as they became "tied to defending political rights," guns also became a symbol of citizenship. Cramer draws on many primary sources, from newspaper accounts to probate records, and compiles impressive data supporting his case. Still, he misses many opportunities for analysis and interpretation. For example, he finds that it was "not terribly unusual" for free women to own guns, but offers no nuanced discussion of what said gun ownership tells us about gender roles. His attack on academia&#x2014;which, in Cramer's view, has been blinded by ideology and excludes political conservatives&#x2014;distracts from his central theme and will only alienate pro&#x2013;gun-control readers, leaving him with an equally narrow, if opposite, readership. <i>(Feb. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was a strange place for the procession of a great man to rest: there was no tavern in sight, not even a peasant's hovel. The big sleeping carriage, pulled by eight horses, halted first. The others - there were probably four in all - slowed down and stopped alongside the first on the grass as the footmen and cavalry escort ran to see what was happening. The passengers threw open their carriage doors. When they heard the despair in their master's voice, they hurried towards his carriage.<br><br>`That's enough!' said Prince Potemkin. `That's enough! There is no point in going on now.' Inside the sleeping carriage, there were three harassed doctors and a slim countess with high cheekbones and auburn hair, all crowded round the Prince. He was sweating and groaning. The doctors summoned the Cossacks to move their massive patient. `Take me out of the carriage...' Potemkin ordered. Everyone jumped when he commanded, and he had commanded virtually everything in Russia for a long time. Cossacks and generals gathered round the open door and slowly, gently began to bear out the stricken giant.<br><br>The Countess accompanied him out of the carriage, holding his hand, dabbing his hot brow as tears streamed down her face with its small retrousse nose and full mouth. A couple of p0Moldavian peasants who tended cattle on the nearby steppe ambled over to watch. His bare feet came first, then his legs and his half-open dressing gown - though this vision in itself was not unusual. Potemkin notoriously greeted empresses and ambassadors in bare feet and open dressing gowns. But now it was different. He still had the leonine Slavic handsomeness, the thick head of hair, once regarded as the finest in the Empire, and the sensual Grecian profile that had won him the nickname 'Alcibiades" as a young man. However, his hair was now flecked with grey and hung over his feverish forehead. He was still gigantic in stature and breadth. Everything about him was exaggerated, colossal and original, but his life of reckless indulgence and relentless ambition had bloated his body and aged his face. Like a Cyclops he had only one eye; the other was blind and damaged, giving him the appearance of a pirate. His chest was broad and hairy. Always a force of nature, he now resembled nothing so much as a magnificent animal reduced to this twitching, shivering pile of flesh.<br><br>The apparition on this wild steppe was His Most Serene Highness Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin, probably husband of the Empress of Russia, Catherine the Great, and certainly the love of her life, the best friend of the woman, the co-ruler of her Empire and the partner in her dreams. He was Prince of Taurida, Field-Marshal, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, Grand Herman of the Black Sea and Ekaterinoslav Cossacks, Grand Admiral of the Black Sea and Caspian Fleets, President of the College of War, viceroy of the south, and possibly the next King of Poland, or of some other principality of his own making.<br><br>The Prince, or Serenissimus, as he was known across the Russian Empire, had ruled with Catherine 11 for nearly two decades. They had known each other for thirty years and had shared each other's lives for almost twenty. Beyond that, the Prince defied, and still defies, all categorization. Catherine noticed him as a witty young man and summoned him to be her lover at a time of crisis. When their affair ended, he remained her friend, partner and minister and became her co-Tsar. She always feared, respected and loved him - but their relationship was stormy. She called him her `Colossus', and her `tiger', her `idol', `hero', the `greatest eccentric'.' This was the `genius" who hugely increased her Empire, created Russia's Black Sea Fleet, conquered the Crimea, won the Second Turkish War and founded famed cities such as Sebastopol and Odessa. Russia had not possessed an imperial statesman of such success in both dreams and deeds since Peter the Great.<br><br>Serenissimus made his own policies - sometimes inspired, sometimes quixotic - and constructed his own world. While his power depended on his partnership with Catherine, he thought and behaved like one of the sovereign powers of Europe. Potemkin dazzled its Cabinets and Courts with his titanic achievements, erudite knowledge and exquisite taste, while simultaneously scandalizing them with his arrogance and debauchery, indolence and luxury. While hating him for his power and inconsistency, even his enemies acclaimed his intelligence and creativity.<br>Now this barefoot Prince half staggered - and was half carried by his Cossacks across the grass. This was a remote and spectacular spot, not even on the main road between Jassy, in today's Rumania, and Kishnev, in today's Republic of Moldova. In those days, this was the territory of the Ottoman Sultan, conquered by Potemkin. Even today it is hard to find, but in 200 years it has hardly changed. The spot where they laid Potemkin was a little plateau beside a steep stone lane whence one could see far in every direction. The countryside to the right was a rolling green valley rising in a multitude of green, bushy mounds into the distance, covered in the now almost vanished high grass of the steppes. To the left, forested hills fell away into the mist. Straight ahead, Potemkin's entourage would have seen the lane go down and then rise up a higher hill covered in dark. trees and thick bushes, disappearing down the valley. Potemkin, who loved to drive his carriage at night through the rain,' had called a stop in a place of the wildest and most beautiful natural drama.'<br><br>His entourage could only have added to it. The confection of the exotic and the civilized in Potemkin's companions that day reflected his contradictions: `Prince Potemkin is the emblem of the immense Russian Empire,' wrote the Prince de Ligne, who knew him well, `he too is composed of deserts and goldmines.'' His Court - for he was almost royal, though Catherine teasingly called it his `bassecour', halfway between a royal court and a farmyard' emerged on to the steppe.<br><br>Many of his attendants were already weeping. The Countess, the only woman present, wore the long-sleeved flowing Russian robes favoured by her friend the Empress, but her stockings and shoes were the finest of French fashion, ordered from Paris by Serenissimus himself. Her travelling jewellery was made up of priceless diamonds from Potemkin's unrivalled collection. Then there were generals and counts in tailcoats and uniforms with sashes and medals and tricorn hats that would not have been remarkable at Horse-Guards in London or any eighteenth-century court, but there was also a sprinkling of Cossack atamans, Oriental princelings, Moldavian boyars, renegade Ottoman pashas, servants, clerks, common soldiers - and the bishops, rabbis, fakirs and mullahs whose company Potemkin most enjoyed. Nothing relaxed him as much as a discussion on Byzantine theology, the customs of some Eastern tribe such as the Bashkirs, or Palladian architecture, Dutch painting, Italian music, English Gardens . . .<br>li0The bishops sported the flowing robes of Orthodoxy, the rabbis the tangled ringlets of Judaism, the Ottoman renegades the turbans, pantaloons and slippers of the Sublime Porte. The Moldavians, Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Sultan, wore bejewelled kaftans and high hats encircled with fur and encrusted with rubies, the ordinary Russian soldiers the 'Potemkin' hats, coats, soft boots and buckskin trousers designed for their ease by the Prince himself. Lastly the Cossacks, most of them Boat Cossacks known as Zaporogians, had fierce moustaches and shaven heads except for a tuft on top leading down the back in a long ponytail, like characters from Last o f the Mohicans, and brandished short curved daggers, engraved pistols and their special long lances. They watched sadly, for Potemkin adored the Cossacks.<br><br>The woman was Potemkin's shrewd and haughty niece, Countess Alexandra Branicka, aged thirty-seven and a formidable political force in her own right. Potemkin's love affairs with the Empress and a brazen parade of noblewomen and courtesans had shocked even French courtiers who remembered Louis XV's Versailles. Had he really made all five of his legendarily beautiful nieces into his mistresses? Did he love Countess Branicka the most of all?<br><br>The Countess ordered them to place a rich Persian rug on the grass. Then she let them lower Prince Potemkin gently on to it. `I want to die in the field,' he said as they settled him there. He had spent the previous fifteen years travelling as fast across Russia's vastness as any man in the eighteenth century: `a trail of sparks marks his swift journey', wrote the poet Gavrili Derzhavin in his ode to Potemkin, The Waterfall. So, appropriately for a man of perpetual movement, who barely lived in his innumerable palaces, Serenissimus added that he did not want to die in a carriage.y He wanted to sleep out on the steppe.<br><br>That morning, Potemkin asked his beloved Cossacks to build him a makeshift tent of their lances, covered with blankets and furs. It was a characteristically Potemkinian idea, as if the purity of a little Cossack camp would cure him of all his suffering.<br><br>The anxious doctors, a Frenchman and two Russians, gathered round the prone Prince and the attentive Countess, but there was little they could do. Catherine and Potemkin thought doctors made better players at the card table than healers at the bedside. The Empress joked that her Scottish doctor finished off most of his patients with his habitual panacea for every ailment a weakening barrage of emetics and bleedings. The doctors were afraid that they would be blamed if the Prince perished, because accusations of poisoning were frequently whispered at the Russian Court. Yet the eccentric Potemkin had been a thoroughly uncooperative patient, opening all the windows, having eau-de-Cologne poured on his head, consuming whole salted geese from Hamburg with gallons of wine - and now setting off on this tormented journey across the steppes.<br><br>The Prince was dressed in a rich silk dressing gown, lined with fur, sent to him days earlier by the Empress all the way from distant St Petersburg, almost two thousand versts. Its inside pockets bulged with bundles of the Empress's secret letters in which she consulted her partner, gossiped with her friend and decided the policies of her Empire. She destroyed most of his letters, but we are grateful that he romantically kept many of hers in that sentimental pocket next to his heart.<br><br>Twenty years of these letters reveal an equal and amazingly successful partnership of two statesmen and lovers that was startling in its modernity, touching in its ordinary intimacy and impressive in its statecraft. Their love affair and political alliance was unequalled in history by Antony and Cleopatra, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon and Josephine, because it was as remarkable for its achievements as for its romance, as endearing for its humanity as for its power. Like everything to do with Potemkin, his life with Catherine was crisscrossed with mysteries: were they secretly married? Did they conceive a child together? Did they really share power? Is it true that they agreed to remain partners while indulging themselves with a string of other lovers? Did Potemkin pimp for the Empress, procuring her young favourites, and did she help him seduce his nieces and turn the Imperial Palace into his own family harem?<br><br>As his illness ebbed and flowed, his travels were pursued by Catherine's caring, wifely notes, as she sent dressing gowns and fur coats for him to wear, scolded him for eating too much or not taking his medicines, begged him to rest and recover, and prayed to God not to take her beloved. He wept as he read them.<br><br>At this very moment, the Empress's couriers were galloping in two directions across Russia, changing their exhausted horses at imperial post-houses. They came from St Petersburg, bearing Catherine's latest letter to the Prince, and from here in Moldavia they bore his latest to her. It had been so for a long time - and they were always longing to receive the freshest news of the other. But now the letters were sadder.<br><br>`My dear friend, Prince Grigory Alexandrovich,' she wrote on 3 October, `I received your letters of the 25th and 27th today a few hours ago and I confess that I am extremely worried by them .. . I pray God that He gives health back to you soon.' She was not worried when she wrote this, because it usually took ten days for letters to reach the capital from the south, though it could be done in seven, hell for leather. Ten days before, Potemkin appeared to have recovered - hence Catherine's calmness. But a few days earlier on 30 September, before his health seemed to improve, her letters were almost frantic. `My worry about your sickness knows no bounds,' she had written. `For Christ's sake, if necessary, take whatever the doctors think might ease your condition. I beg God to give you your energy and health back as soon as possible. Goodbye my friend ... I'm sending you a fur coat ...'. This was just sound and fury - for, while the coat was sent on earlier, neither of the letters reached him in time.<br><br>Somewhere in the 2,000 versts that separated the two of them, the couriers must have crossed paths. Catherine would not have been so optimistic if she had read Potemkin's letter, written on 4 October, the day before, as he set out. `Matushka [Little Mother] Most Merciful Lady,' he dictated to his secretary, `I have no energy left to suffer my torments. The only escape is to leave this town and I have ordered them to carry me to Nikolaev. I do not know what will become of me. Most faithful and grateful subject.' This was written in the secretary's hand but pathetically, at the bottom of the letter, Potemkin scrawled in a weak, angular and jumping hand: `The only escape is to leave.' It was unsigned.<br><br>The last batch of Catherine's letters to reach him had arrived the day before in the pouch of Potemkin's fastest courier, Brigadier Bauer, the devoted adjutant whom he often sent galloping to Paris to bring back silk stockings, to Astrakhan for sterlet soup, to Petersburg for oysters, to Moscow to bring back a dancer or a chessplayer, to Milan for a sheet of music, a virtuoso violinist or a wagon of perfumes. So often and so far had Bauer travelled on Potemkin's whim that he jokingly requested this for his epitaph: `Cy git Bauer sous ce rocher, Fouette, cocher!' ('Here lies Bauer under this stone, Coachman, drive on.!'<br><br>As they gathered round him on the steppe, the officials and courtiers would have reflected on the implications of this scene .for Europe, for their Empress, for the unfinished war with the Turks, for the possibilities of action against revolutionary France and defiant Poland. Potemkin's armies and fleets had conquered huge tracts of Ottoman territory around the Black Sea and in today's Rumania: now the Sultan's Grand Vizier hoped to negotiate a peace with him.

The novel&#39;s protagonist, living at a time that might be the present in a city that might be anywhere, has decided for reasons of mental hygiene to keep a detailed record of his thoughts, words, and deeds. Very quickly, however, the project begins to absorb his entire life, as the increasingly meticulous recording of experience threatens to supplant experience itself. To make matters worse, what he records offers its own grist for worry: his devoted wife suddenly grows secretive, his equally devoted mistress turns evasive, his frustratingly independent son might or might not be visiting that same mistress behind his back, and his closest friend begins acting in mysterious ways (and is it just his imagination, or is this friend having clandestine meetings with his wife?). His ever more convoluted perceptions breed a dark muddle of suspicion, leading to a climax that is at once intensely funny and excruciatingly poignant.</p><p>Marie Chaix was born in Lyons and raised in Paris, and is the author of nine books. The Summer of the Elder Tree, a memoir and meditation on the theme of separation, and her first book in more than a decade, was published in Paris in 2005, and will appear from Dalkey Archive Press in 2013.There are no safe places for the disintegrating self, not even the private journal; that is what the unnamed ``journalist'' discovers in this teasing, lightly involving novel from Mathews (Singular Pleasures, 1993, etc.). Middle-aged, middle-class, he lives in a college town in an unidentified country. He has an unglamorous office job, a loving wife (Daisy), an equally loving mistress (Colette), and a lovable if enigmatic son in high school (Gert). Daisy and his doctor, worried about his mental state, suggest he keep a journal, and he starts his new project with zest, seeing it as a ``a hold on reality,'' a way of reconciling his two selves--the one that experiences life with the one that observes it. Soon enough, however, this journal, which he had envisioned as an instrument of control, turns into a tyrant that controls him. He becomes obsessed with the right way of classifying experience, and the margins sprout headings and subheadings like weeds. Meanwhile, his relationships are suffering. Daisy turns secretive, and his best friend, Paul, is avoiding him. Could they be having an affair? Why is Gert suddenly so friendly with Colette: More mischief? And why is there never enough time for his lonely task of keeping his journal and getting it right? He cuts back on sleep (his love life is already a thing of the past) and uses the office for his writing, until his boss forces him to take indefinite leave. ``I've lost them,'' he acknowledges, referring to all the people in his life, just before his final dissolution and hospitalization, when a new narrative voice supplies rather too pat explanations for all the puzzles. Not as bleak as it sounds. Mathews chronicles his diarist's dilemma with humor and gentle irony; his slide into the abyss occasions more bemusement than terror. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Dr. William Owens explains, in clear language, the basics of respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. This is a guide to keep in your jacket pocket, call room, or in the ICU.The second edition includes new chapters on capnography and acid-base problem solving, ventilator weaning protocols, and is updated to reflect current medical evidence. Conventional and unconventional modes of ventilation are examined and explained. PEEP, flow, ventilator liberation, and the care of the patient with prolonged respiratory failure are also covered. The goal of &#34;The Ventilator Book&#34; is to make difficult concepts easy to understand.Conventional medical textbooks are great references, but they are heavy and can&#39;t be easily carried around by clinicians who are busy taking care of patients. They also are written to be an exhaustive, authoritative reference, which means that they often contain far more information than what you need at the bedside to help with a difficult case. &#34;The Ventilator Book&#34; has enough information to teach anyone about mechanical ventilation, but not so much that reading it becomes intimidating.</p><p>William Owens, MD, is the Director of the Medical Intensive Care Unit at Palmetto Health Richland, a tertiary referral center in Columbia, SC.

Lewis&#39; timeless classic, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, lovingly brought to life in the original design and with the original illustrations. The most loved of all the Chronicles, this wonderful tale can be enjoyed again and again. &#34;This is the land of Narnia,&#34; said the Faun, &#34;where we are now. And you -- you have come from the wild woods of the west?&#34; &#34;I -- I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,&#34; said Lucy. Lucy steps into the Professor&#39;s wardrobe -- but steps out again into a snowy forest. She&#39;s stumbled upon the magical world of Narnia, land of unicorns, centaurs, fauns! and the wicked White Witch, who terrorises all. Lucy soon realises that Narnia, and in particular Aslan, the great Lion, needs her help if the country&#39;s creatures are ever going to be free again.</p><p>Fifty years ago, a book about four children, a magical wardrobe, an enchanted land, an evil witch and a kingly lion was published, and the genre of children&#39;s fantasy was changed forever. Since then, C. S. Lewis&#39;s first and best-loved book about Narnia has been read and cherished by millions of children and adults. Now - relive the magic in this, the first unabridged audio recording of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably one of the most influential writers of his day. He was a fellow and tutor in English Literature at Oxford University until 1954 when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. Pauline Bayne&#39;s work on the Chronicles spans almost fifty years.</p><h2>The Goodbye Quilt</h2><p>Linda Davis's local fabric shop is a place where women gather to share their creations: wedding quilts, baby quilts, memorial quilts, each bound tight with dreams, hopes and yearnings.<br><br>Now, as her only child readies for college, Linda is torn between excitement for Molly and heartache for herself. Who will she be when she is no longer needed in her role as mom?<br><br>As mother and daughter embark on a cross-country road trip to move Molly into her dorm, Linda pieces together the scraps that make up Molly's young life--the hem of a christening gown, a snippet from a Halloween costume. And in the stitching of each bit of fabric, Linda discovers that the memories of a shared journey can come together in a way that will keep them both warm in the years to come....</p><p>When Susan Wiggs's recent novel, <i>Fireside</i>, landed at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list, the author responded by jumping fully clothed into her swimming pool. In February. In the Pacific Northwest. After thawing herself out, the author put on her lipstick and vacuumed the living room. Why? Because on the tiny island where she lives, news travels fast. She knew her girlfriends would show up momentarily - which they did - with the customary champagne and bags of Cheetos. She toasted her loyal readers, whose unflagging interest in her books propelled her sales upward. She toasted her friends and family as well, since they have always been the source of her inspiration. From the very start, her writings have illuminated the everyday dramas of ordinary people. At the age of eight, she self-published her first novel, entitled A Book About Some Bad Kids. Today, she is an international best-selling author, with millions of copies of her books in print in numerous countries. Her Lakeshore Chronicles novels celebrate the power of love, the timeless bonds of family and the nuances of human nature that make headlines every day. She lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest and is perpetually working on her next novel.<br><br>How do you say goodbye to a piece of your heart? If you're a quilter, you have a time-honored way to express yourself.<br><br>A quilt is an object of peculiar intimacy. By virtue of the way it is created, every inch of the fabric is touched. Each scrap absorbs the quilter's scent and the invisible oils of her skin, the smell of her household and, thanks to the constant pinning and stitching, her blood in the tiniest of quantities. And tears, though she might be loath to admit it.<br><br>My adult life has been a patchwork of projects, most of which were fleeting fancies of overreaching vision. I tend to seize on things, only to abandon them due to a lack of time, talent or inclination.<br><br>There are a few things I'm truly good at&#x2014;<em>-Jeopardy!, </em>riding a bike, balancing a checkbook, orienteering, making balloon animals...and quilting.<br><br>I'm good at pulling together little bits and pieces of disparate objects. The process suits me. Each square captures my attention like a new landscape. Everything about quilting suits me, an occupation for hands and heart and imagination.<br><br>Other things didn't work out so well&#x2014;Szechuan cooking, topiary gardening, video games and philately come to mind.<br><br>My main project, my ultimate work-in-progress, is Molly, of course. And today she's going away to college, clear across the country. Correction&#x2014;I'm taking her away, delivering her like an insured parcel to a new life.<br><br>Hence the quilt. What better memento to give my daughter than a handmade quilt to keep in her dorm room, a comforter stitched with all the memories of her childhood? It'll be a tangible reminder of who she is, where she comes from...and maybe, if I'm lucky, it will offer a glimpse of her dreams.<br><br>All my quilting supplies come from a shop in town called Pins &amp; Needles. The place occupies a vintage building on the main street. It's been in continuous operation for more than five decades. As a child, I passed its redbrick and figured concrete storefront on my way to school each day, and I still remember the kaleidoscope of fabrics in the window, flyers announcing classes and raffles, the rainbow array of rich-colored thread, the treasure trove of glittering notions. My first job as a teenager was at the shop, cutting fabric and ringing up purchases.<br><br>When Molly started school, I worked there part time, as much for the extra money as for the company of women who frequented Pins &amp; Needles. Fall is wonderful at the fabric shop, a nesting time, when people are making Halloween costumes, Thanksgiving centerpieces and Christmas decorations. People are never in a hurry in a fabric shop. They browse. They talk about their projects, giving you a glimpse of their lives.<br><br>The shop is a natural gathering place for women. The people I've met there through the years have become my friends. Customers and staff members stand around the cutting tables to discuss projects, give demonstrations and workshops, offer advice on everything from quilting techniques to child rearing to marriage. The ladies there all know about my idea to make a quilt as a going-away gift for Molly. Some of them even created pieces for me to add, embroidered with messages of "Good Luck" and "Congratulations."<br><br>You can always tell what's going on in a woman's life based on the quilt she's working on. The new-baby quilts are always light and soft, the wedding quilts pure and clean, filled with tradition, as though a beautiful design might be an inoculation against future strife. Housewarming quilts tend to be artistic, suitable for hanging on an undecorated wall. The most lovingly created quilts of all are the memory quilts, often created as a group project to commemorate a significant event, help with healing or to celebrate a life.<br><br>I've always thought a quilt held together with a woman's tears to be the strongest of all.<br><br>Nonquilters have a hard time getting their heads around the time and trouble of a project like this. My friend Cherisse, who has three kids, said, "Linda, honey, I'm just glad to get them out of the house&#x2014;up and running, with no criminal record." Another friend confessed, "My daughter would only ruin it. She's so careless with her things." My neighbor Erin, who started law school when her son entered first grade, now works long hours and makes a ton of money. "I wish I had the time," she said wistfully when I showed her my project.<br><br>What I've found is that you make time for the things that matter to you. Everyone <em>has </em>the time. It's just a question of deciding what to do with that time. For some people, it's providing for their family. For others, it's finding that precarious balance between taking care of business and the soul-work of being there for husband, children, friends and neighbors.<br><br>I'm supposed to be making the last-minute preparations before our departure on the epic road trip, but instead I find myself dithering over the quilt, cont emplating sashing and borders and whether my color palette is strong and balanced. Although the top is pieced, the backing and batting in place, there is still much work to be done. Embellishments to add. It might not be proper quilting technique, but quilting is an art, not a science. My crafter's bag is filled with snippets of fabric culled from old, familiar clothes, fabric toys and textiles that have been outgrown, but were too dear or too damaged to take to the Goodwill bin. I'm a big believer in charity bins. Just because a garment is no longer suitable doesn't mean it couldn't be right for someone else. On the other hand, some things are not meant to be parted with.<br><br>I sift through the myriad moments of Molly's childhood, which I keep close to my heart, like flowers from a prized bouquet, carefully pressed between sheets of blotter paper. I fold the quilt and put it in the bag with all the bright bits and mementos&#x2014;a tiny swatch of a babydoll's nightie, an official-looking Girl Scout badge, a precious button that is the only survivor of her first Christmas dress.... So many memories lie mute within this long-handled bag, waiting for me to use them as the final embellishments on this work of art.<br><br>I'll never finish in time.<br><br>You can do this. I try to give myself a pep talk, but the words fall through my mind and trickle away. This is unexpected, this inability to focus. A panic I haven't been expecting rises up in me, grabbing invisibly at my chest. Breathe, I tell myself. Breathe.<br><br>The house already feels different; a heaviness hangs in the drapes over the old chintz sofa. Sounds echo on the wooden floors&#x2014;a suitcase being rolled to the front porch, a set of keys dropped on the hall table. An air of change hovers over everything.<br><br>Dan has driven to the Chevron station to fill the Suburban's tank. He's not coming; this long drive without him will be a first for our family. Until now, every road trip has involved all three of us&#x2014;Yellowstone, Bryce Canyon, Big Sur, speeding along endless highways with the music turned up loud. We did everything as a family. I can't even remember what Dan and I used to do before Molly. Those days seem like a life that happened to someone else. We were a couple, but Molly made us a family.<br><br>This time, Dan will stay home with Hoover, who is getting on in years and doesn't do well at the kennel anymore.<br><br>It's better this way. Dan was never fond of saying goodbye. Not that anybody enjoys it, but in our family, I'm always the stoic, the one who makes the emotional work look easy&#x2014;on the outside, anyway. My solo drive back home will be another first for me. I hope I'll use the time well, getting to know myself again, maybe. Scary thought&#x2014;what if I get to know myself and I'm someone I don't want to be?<br><br>Now, as the heaviness of the impending departure presses down on me, I wonder if we should have planned things differently. Perhaps the three of us should have made this journey together, treating it as a family vacation, like a trip to Disney World or the Grand Canyon.<br><br>On the other hand, that's a bad idea. There can be no fooling ourselves into thinking this is something other than what it is&#x2014;the willful ejection of Molly from our nest. It's too late for second thoughts, anyway. She has to be moved into her dorm in time for freshman orientation. It's been marked on the kitchen calendar for weeks&#x2014;the expiration date on her childhood.<br><br>At the other end of the downstairs, a chord sounds on the piano. Molly tends to sit down and play when she has a lot on her mind. Maybe it's her way of sorting things out.<br><br>I'm grateful for the years of lessons she took, even when we could barely afford them. I wanted my daughter to have things I never had, and music lessons are one of them. She's turned into an expressive musician, transforming standard pieces into something heartfelt and mystical. Showy trills and glissandos sluice through the air, filling every empty space in the house. The piano will sit fallow and silent when she's away; neither Dan nor I play. He never had the time to learn; I never had the wherewithal or&#x2014;I admit it&#x2014;the patience. Ah, but Molly. She was fascinated with the instrument from the time she stretched up on toddler legs to reach the keys of the secondhand piano we bought at auction. She started lessons when she was only six.<br><br>All the hours of practice made up the sound track of her growing years. "Bill Grogan's Goat" was an early favorite, leading to more challenging works, from "The Rainbow Connection" to "Fur Elise," Bartok and beyond. Almost every evening for the past twelve years, Molly practiced while Dan and I cleaned up after dinner. This was her way of avoiding dishwashing duty, and we considered it a fair division of labor&#x2014;I rinse, he loads, she serenades. She managed to make it to age eighteen without learning to properly load a dishwasher, yet she can play Rachmaninoff.<br><br>In the middle of a dramatic pause between chords, a car horn sounds.<br><br>The bag with the quilt falls, momentarily forgotten, to the floor. That innocent <em>yip </em>of the horn signals that summer has ended.<br><br>Molly stops playing, leaving a profound hollow of silence in the house. Seconds later, I can still feel the throb of the notes in the stillness. I go to the landing at the turn of the stairs in time to see her jump up, leaving the piano bench askew.<br><br>She runs outside, the screen door snapping shut behind her like a mousetrap. Watching through the window on the landing, I brace myself for another storm of emotion. She has been saying goodbye to Travis all summer long. Today, the farewell will be final.<br><br>Here is a picture of Molly: Curly hair wadded into a messy ponytail. Athletic shorts balanced on her hip bones, a T-shirt with a dead rock star on it. A body toned by youth, volleyball and weekend swims at the lake. A face that shows every emotion, even when she doesn't want it to.<br><br>Now she flings herself into her boyfriend's arms as a sob breaks from her, mingling with the sound of morning birdsong. Oh, that yearning, the piercing kind only love-dazed teenagers can feel. Hands holding for the last time. Grief written in their posture as their bodies melt together. Travis's arms encircle her with their ropy strength, and his long form bows protectively, walling her off from me.<br><br></p><h2>The Dictionary of Heraldry</h2><p>Physical description; xvi, 240 p. : ill.

So when Barbara Kingsolver sends missionary Nathan Price along with his wife and four daughters off to Africa in <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i>, you can be sure that salvation is the one thing they're not likely to find. The year is 1959 and the place is the Belgian Congo. Nathan, a Baptist preacher, has come to spread the Word in a remote village reachable only by airplane. To say that he and his family are woefully unprepared would be an understatement: "We came from Bethlehem, Georgia, bearing Betty Crocker cake mixes into the jungle," says Leah, one of Nathan's daughters. But of course it isn't long before they discover that the tremendous humidity has rendered the mixes unusable, their clothes are unsuitable, and they've arrived in the middle of political upheaval as the Congolese seek to wrest independence from Belgium. In addition to poisonous snakes, dangerous animals, and the hostility of the villagers to Nathan's fiery take-no-prisoners brand of Christianity, there are also rebels in the jungle and the threat of war in the air. Could things get any worse? <p> In fact they can and they do. The first part of <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> revolves around Nathan's intransigent, bullying personality and his effect on both his family and the village they have come to. As political instability grows in the Congo, so does the local witch doctor's animus toward the Prices, and both seem to converge with tragic consequences about halfway through the novel. From that point on, the family is dispersed and the novel follows each member's fortune across a span of more than 30 years. </p><p> <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> is arguably Barbara Kingsolver's most ambitious work, and it reveals both her great strengths and her weaknesses. As Nathan Price's wife and daughters tell their stories in alternating chapters, Kingsolver does a good job of differentiating the voices. But at times they can grate--teenage Rachel's tendency towards precious malapropisms is particularly annoying (students practice their "French congregations"; Nathan's refusal to take his family home is a "tapestry of justice"). More problematic is Kingsolver's tendency to wear her politics on her sleeve; this is particularly evident in the second half of the novel, in which she uses her characters as mouthpieces to explicate the complicated and tragic history of the Belgian Congo. </p><p> Despite these weaknesses, Kingsolver's fully realized, three-dimensional characters make <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> compelling, especially in the first half, when Nathan Price is still at the center of the action. And in her treatment of Africa and the Africans she is at her best, exhibiting the acute perception, moral engagement, and lyrical prose that have made her previous novels so successful. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"The Poisonwood Bible" is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it--from garden seeds to Scripture--is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa. <p>The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Against this backdrop, Orleanna Price reconstructs the story of her evangelist husband's part in the Western assault on Africa, a tale indelibly darkened by her own losses and unanswerable questions about her own culpability. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four daughters--the self-centered, teenaged Rachel; shrewd adolescent twins Leah and Adah; and Ruth May, a prescient five-year-old. These sharply observant girls, who arrive in the Congo with racial preconceptions forged in 1950s Georgia, will be marked in surprisingly different ways by their father's intractable mission, and by Africa itself. Ultimately each must strike her own separate path to salvation. Their passionately intertwined stories become a compelling exploration of moral risk and personal responsibility. </p><p>Dancing between the dark comedy of human failings and thebreathtaking possibilities of human hope, "The Poisonwood Bible" possesses all that has distinguished Barbara Kingsolver's previous work, and extends this beloved writer's vision to an entirely new level. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, this ambitious novel establishes Kingsolver as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers.</p></p><h2>Reality Therapy in Action</h2><p><blockquote>"Dr. Glasser's therapy is based on inescapable truths: Meaningful relationships are central to the good life, the choices we make will determine their quality, and we can only create them if we take responsibility for ourselves without controlling the other person. His vivid stories and dialogues illustrate how to go about creating a good life." -- From the foreword by Peter Breggin, M.D.</blockquote><p></p><p>In this long-awaited continuation of his most successful book, <em>Reality Therapy,</em> Dr. William Glasser takes readers into his consulting room and illustrates through a series of conversations with his patients, exactly how he puts his popular therapeutic theories into practice.</p><p>Dr. Glasser introduces us to among others:</p><p></p><ul><li>Jerry, who is trying to overcome his obsessive-complusive disorder,<p></p><p></p></li><li>Bea and Jim, a couple who want to rebuild their relationship after Jim's affair, and<p></p><p></p></li><li>Roger, an alcoholic in desperate need of a meaningful relationship </li></ul><p></p><p>These vivid, almost novelistic case histories bring Dr. Glasser's new version of this therapy to life, and show readers how to get rid of the controlling, punishing, <em>i know what's right for you </em> psychology that crops up in most situations when. people face conflict with one another. </p><p>Practical and readable, <em>Reality Therapy in Action</em> is Dr. Glasser's most accessible book in years.</p></p><p><p>William Glasser, M.D., is a world-renowned psychiatrist who lectures widely. His numerous books have sold 1.7 million copies, and he has trained thousands of counselors in his Choice Theory and Reality Therapy approaches. He is also the president of the William Glasser Institute in Los Angeles.</p>"'It is what you choose to do in a relationship, not what others choose to do, that is the heart of reality therapy.' This quote perhaps best summarizes Dr. Glasser's break from external control psychology and emphasis on choice and responsibility. This book focuses on relationships and provides insight into the mind of one of psychotherapy's giants. The pragmatic writing style allows one to not only learn about reality therapy but also about life." -- <i>Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D., ABPP, distinguished professor of psychology and counseling, Governors State University</i><br><br>"I appreciate Dr. Glasser's elaboration on the theme of creating satisfying relationships in our lives. I particularly like the existential emphasis on the roles of choice and responsibility. This book reinforces the notion that we <i>do </i> have choices and that we contribute to our degree of happiness by how we think and act in our present-day living." -- <i>Gerald Corey, Ed.D., A.B.P.P., professor of human services and counseling, California State University, Fullerton</i><br><br>"I greatly enjoyed reading <i>Reality Therapy in Action</i>, and think it one of the most creative books on psychotherapy ever written. . . . I especially recommend some of the main things he does, such as marital and parental therapy. They are most effective and deserve to be widely copied by therapists." -- <i>Albert Ellis, Ph.D., president of Albert Ellis Institute for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy</i><br><br>"When one chooses the road's beginning, one chooses a destination. An inspiring trailblazer with a wealth of practical information and timeless wisdom, William Glasser is one of history's preeminent psychotherapists. In<i> Reality Therapy in Action</i> he maps an easy route for those in pain to reclaim direction, to reclaim their desired destinations." -- <i>Jeffrey K. Zeig, Ph.D., director of the Milton H. Erickson Foundation</i><br><br>"William Glasser is a brilliant therapist, and he has written another brilliant book. The case-study format that he has developed with this work allows the reader to feel as though he or she is experiencing and participating in the therapy sessions. . . . Dr. Glasser writes like a novelist, playwright, or short story author, but most important, he clearly explains the basic precepts of choice theory and reality therapy and shows the reader how these constructs can be used in real therapy sessions to help real people change their behavior and their lives." -- <i>Gary G.

Quintin Jardine is married with four adult kids and divides his time between Scotland and Spain.A vicious and possibly insane killer is stalking Edinburgh's Royal Mile in this striking debut, nominated for England's John Creasey Award for Best First Novel. The mutilated and decapitated body of advocate Michael Mortimer is discovered in what seems to be an isolated incident. More vicious murders suggest the work of a serial killer, but then Mortimer's lover, Rachel Jameson, dies when she is pushed under a train. Detective Chief Superintendent Robert Skinner of the Edinburgh police discovers that Mortimer and Jameson had successfully represented the defendants in a rape-murder case. When one of the defendants turns up dead and mutilated, political considerations prevent Skinner from jailing his suspect. His doubts about the motive behind the murders become certainty, leading him into a maze of dangerous and conflicting loyalties where his own rules of conduct are no longer valid. Solid plotting (including surprises) and short, snappy chapters that tell the story through action and dialogue leave the story lacking only in convincing atmosphere. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Evil that Men Do (A Dorothy Martin Mystery, 11)</h2><p><p><b><i>The new &#x2018;Dorothy Martin&#x2019; mystery - </i></b>Dorothy Martin and her husband, retired Chief Constable Alan Nesbitt, are on holiday in the idyllic English village of Broadway when they stumble across the body of a man who appears to have fallen down a disused quarry. When it is revealed that the man, a local farmer, was probably pushed over the edge, and that the police have failed to find any suspects or motives for the murder, Dorothy can&#x2019;t help but get involved . . .</p></p><p>Jeanne M. Dams, an American, is a devout Anglophile who has wished she could live in England ever since her first visit in 1963. Fortunately, her alter ego, Dorothy Martin, can do just that. Jeanne lives in South Bend, Indiana, with a varying population of cats.American ex-pat Dorothy Martin and her British husband, retired chief constable Alan Nesbitt, are on holiday in the Cotswolds. While hiking and enjoying the beautiful scenery near the village of Broadway, they discover the body of a man at the bottom of a quarry. The police learn that the victim, a local farmer, was probably pushed over the edge, but they have no suspects. Dorothy&#x2019;s curiosity gets the better of her, and despite Alan&#x2019;s admonition to leave it alone, she begins asking questions. A young man whom they met before discovering the body makes her suspicious. (No shrewd sleuthing there, as he was covered with blood.) Quickly it becomes clear that the insular locals do not appreciate Dorothy and Alan asking questions, which, of course, makes our heroes more determined than ever to solve the crime. Dams sticks a little too close to formula here, but she does it with style, and British cozy fans will enjoy the idyllic Cotswolds setting. --Barbara Bibel</p><h2>Norman Rockwell: Artist and Illustrator</h2><p>Norman Rockwell: Artist And Illustrator by Buechner, Thomas S.</p><p></p><h2>Anancy the Spider Man</h2><p>The legend of Anansi is a legend told by storytellers and parents throughout the world, and Philip Sherlock brings this original Spider Man to life!<br><br>Fifteen Jamaican folk tales, illustrated with over fifty black and white drawings.</p><p>As a child growing up in Jamaica, Philip Sherlock listened in the evenings to these West Indian tales, which he now retells with humor and warmth.<br>The illustrator, Marcia Brown, knows well the background atmosphere for these tales, and her drawings capture completely their gaiety and subtlety.</p><h2>The Curse of the Creeping Coffin (Give Yourself Goosebumps, No 8) (Give Yourself Goosebumps, 8)</h2><p>Readers are placed into the life of a character who visits Grandmother and her spooky home, which borders a graveyard filled with headstones that creep closer and closer every day, in a story with more than twenty possible endings.

Godless, fatherless, childless, and divorced, aaliya is her family&#39;s &#39;unnecessary appendage&#39;. Every year, she translates a new favourite book into arabic, then stows it away. The thirty-seven books that aaliya has translated over her lifetime have never been read - by anyone. This breathtaking portrait of a reclusive woman follows aaliya&#39;s digressive mind as it ricochets across visions of past and present beirut. Colourful musings on literature, philosophy, and art are invaded by memories of the lebanese civil war and aaliya&#39;s own volatile past. As she tries to overcome her ageing body and spontaneous emotional upwellings, aaliya is faced with an unthinkable disaster that threatens to shatter the little life she has left. A love letter to literature and its power to define who we are, the prodigiously gifted rabih alameddine has given us a magnificent rendering of one woman&#39;s life in the middle east.</p><p>Rabih Alameddine is the author of the novels Koolaids, and I, the Divine, The Hakawati, the story collection, The Perv, and most recently, An Unnecessary Woman. He divides his time between San Francisco and Beirut.You could say I was thinking of other things when I shampooed my hair blue, and two glasses of red wine didn&#x2019;t help my concentration.<br><br>Let me explain.<br><br>First, you should know this about me: I have but one mirror in my home, a smudged one at that. I&#x2019;m a conscientious cleaner, you might even say compulsive the sink is immaculately white, its bronze faucets sparkle but I rarely remember to wipe the mirror clean. I don&#x2019;t think we need to consult Freud or one of his many minions to know that there&#x2019;s an issue here.<br><br>I begin this tale with a badly lit reflection. One of the bathroom&#x2019;s two bulbs has expired. I&#x2019;m in the midst of the evening ritual of brushing my teeth, facing said mirror, when a halo surrounding my head snares my attention. Toothbrush in right hand still moving up and down and side to side, left hand reaches for reading glasses lying on the little table next to the toilet. Once on my face atop my obtrusive nose they help me see that I&#x2019;m neither a saint nor saintly but more like the Queen Mother well, an image of the Queen Mother smudged by a schoolgirl&#x2019;s eraser. No halo this, the blue anomaly is my damp hair. A pigment battle rages atop my head, a catfight of mismatched contestants.<br><br>I touch a still-wet lock to test the permanency of the blue tint and end up leaving a sticky stain of toothpaste on it. You can correctly presume that multitasking is not my fort�.<br><br>I lean over the bathtub, pick up the tube of Bel Argent shampoo I bought yesterday. I read the fine print, squinting even with the reading glasses. Yes, I used ten times the amount prescribed while washing my hair. I enjoy a good lather. Reading instructions happens not to be my fort� either.<br><br>Funny. My bathroom tile is rectangular white with two interlocking light blue tulips, and that is almost the same shade as my new dye. Luckily, the blue isn&#x2019;t that of the Israeli flag. Can you imagine? Talk about a brawl of mismatched contestants.<br><br>Usually, vanity isn&#x2019;t one of my concerns, doesn&#x2019;t disconcert me much. However, I&#x2019;d overheard the three witches discussing the unrelenting whiteness of my hair. Joumana, my upstairs neighbor, had suggested that if I used a shampoo like Bel Argent, the white would be less flat. There you have it.<br><br>As I understand it, and I might be wrong as usual, you and I tend to lose short wavelength cones as we age, so we&#x2019;re less able to distinguish the color blue. That&#x2019;s why many people of a certain age have a bluish tint to their hair. Without the tint, they see their hair as pale yellow, or possibly salmon. One hairstylist was describing on the radio how he finally convinced this old woman that her hair was much too blue. However, his client refused to change the color. It was much more important that she see her hair as natural than that the rest of the world do so.<br><br>I&#x2019;d probably get along with the client better than I would with the hairdresser.<br>I too am an old woman, but I have yet to lose many short wavelength cones. I can distinguish the color blue a bit too clearly right now.<br><br>Allow me, my dear friend, to offer a mild defense for being distracted. At the end of the year, before I begin a new project, I read the translation I&#x2019;ve completed. I do final corrections (minor), set the pages in order, and place them in the box. This is part of the ritual, which includes imbibing two glasses of red wine. I also have to admit that the last reading allows me to pat myself on the back, to congratulate myself on completing the project. This year, I translated the superb novel Austerlitz, my second translation of W. G. Sebald. I was reading it today, and for some reason, probably the protagonist&#x2019;s unrequited despair, I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking of Hannah, I couldn&#x2019;t, as if the novel, or my Arabic translation of it, was an inductor into Hannah&#x2019;s world.<br><br>Remembering Hannah, my one intimate, is never easy. I still see her before me at the kitchen table, her plate wiped clean of food, her right cheek resting on the palm of her hand, head tilted slightly, listening, offering that rarest of gifts, her unequivocal attention. My voice had no home until her.<br><br>During my seventy-two years, she was the one person I cared for, the one I told too much boasts, hates, joys, cruel disappointments, all jumbled together. I no longer think of her as often as I used to, but she magically appears in my thoughts every now and then. The traces of Hannah on me have become indelible.<br>Percolating remembrances, red wine, an old woman&#x2019;s shampoo: mix well and end up with blue hair.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll wash my hair once more in the morning, with no-more-tears baby shampoo this time. Hopefully the blue will fade. I can just imagine what the neighbors will say now.<br>For most of my adult life, since I was twenty-two, I&#x2019;ve begun a translation every January first. I do realize that this a holiday and most choose to celebrate, most do not consider working on New Year&#x2019;s Day. Once, as I was leafing through the folio of Beethoven&#x2019;s sonatas, I noticed that only the penultimate, the superb 110 in A-flat major, was dated on the top right corner, as if the composer wanted us to know that he was busy working that Christmas Day in 1821. I too choose to keep busy during holidays.<br><br>Over these last fifty years I&#x2019;ve translated fewer than forty books thirty-seven, if I&#x2019;ve counted correctly. Some books took longer than a year, others refused to be translated, and one or two bored me into submission not the books themselves, but my translation of them. Books in and of themselves are rarely boring, except for memoirs of American presidents (No, No, Nixon) well, memoirs of Americans in general. It&#x2019;s the I live in the richest country in the world yet pity me because I grew up with flat feet and a malodorous vagina but I triumph in the end&#x201d; syndrome. Tfeh!<br><br>Books into boxes boxes of paper, of loose translated sheets. That&#x2019;s my life.<br>I long ago abandoned myself to a blind lust for the written word. Literature is my sandbox. In it I play, build my forts and castles, spend glorious time. It is the world outside that playpen that gives me trouble. I have adapted tamely, though not conventionally, to this visible world so I can retreat without much inconvenience into my world of books. To continue the metaphor, if literature is my sandbox, then the real world is my hourglass an hourglass that drains grain by grain. Literature gives me life, and life kills me.<br><br>Well, life kills everyone.<br><br>But that&#x2019;s a morose subject. Tonight I feel alive blue hair and red wine alive. The end of the year approaches, the beginning of a new year. The year is dead. Long live the year. I will begin my next project. This is the time that excites me most. I pay no attention to the Christmas decorations that burst into fruitful life in various neighborhoods of my city, or the lights welcoming the New Year in other parts. This year, Ashura falls at almost the same time, but I don&#x2019;t care.<br><br>Let the people flagellate themselves into a frenzy of remembrance. Wails, whips, blood: the betrayal of Hussein moves me not.<br><br>Let the masses cover themselves in gold, frankincense, and Chanel to honor their savior&#x2019;s birth. Trivia matters naught to me.<br><br>Beginnings are pregnant with possibilities. As much as I enjoy finishing a translation, it is this time that tickles my marrow most. The ritual of preparation: setting aside the two versions of the book of choice, the papers, the notebook that&#x2019;s to be filled with actual notes, the 2B graphite pencils with the sharpener and Pearl eraser, the pens. Cleaning the reading room, dusting the side table, vacuuming the curtains and the ancient armchair, a navy chenille with knotted fringes hanging off its arms. On the day of genesis, the first of January, I begin the morning with a ceremonial bath, a rite of scrubbing and cleansing, after which I light two candles for Walter Benjamin.<br><br>Let there be light, I say.<br><br>Yes, my dear friend, I am a tad obsessive. For a nonreligious woman, this is my faith.<br>This year, though, for the first time in quite a while, I&#x2019;m not certain about the book I want to work with. This year, for the first time ever, I might have to begin a translation while having blue hair. Aiiee.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve decided on Roberto Bola�o&#x2019;s unfinished novel 2666, but I&#x2019;m nurturing doubts. At over nine hundred pages (in both the English and French versions), it is no small feat, or no short feat. It will take me at least two years. Should I be taking on such long-term projects? Should I be making accommodation for my age? I&#x2019;m not talking about my dying. I am in good health, and women in my family live long. My mother is still going insane. Let&#x2019;s put it this way: I don&#x2019;t hesitate when buying green bananas, but I&#x2019;m slowing down. 2666 is a big project. Savage Detectives required nineteen months, and I believe my work rate isn&#x2019;t what it was then. So I balk.<br><br>Yes, I&#x2019;m healthy, I have to keep reminding myself. During my biannual checkup earlier this week, my doctor insisted that I was in sturdy health, like iron. He&#x2019;s right, of course, and I&#x2019;m grateful, but what he should have compared me to was rusty iron. I feel oxidized. What was it that Yourcenar, as Hadrian, wrote about physicians? A man does not practice medicine for more than thirty years without some falsehood. My doctor has been practicing for longer than that. We&#x2019;ve grown old together. He told me that my heart is in good shape, talked to me with his face hidden behind a computer printout of my lab results. Even I, a Luddite, haven&#x2019;t seen such archaic perforated printouts in years. His mobile phone, a Blackberry lying on the desk next to his left elbow, was definitely the latest model, which should count for something. I have yet to own one. But then, I have no need for a phone, let alone a smart one; no one calls me.<br><br>Please, no pity or insincere compassion. I&#x2019;m not suggesting that I feel sorry for myself because no one calls me, or worse, that you should feel sorry. No one calls me. That&#x2019;s a fact.<br><br>I am alone.<br><br>It is a choice I&#x2019;ve made, yet it&#x2019;s also a choice made with few other options available. Beiruti society wasn&#x2019;t fond of divorced childless women in those days.<br><br>Still, I made my bed a simple, comfortable, and adequate bed, I might add.<br>I was fourteen when I began my first translation, twenty dull pages from a science textbook. It was the year I fell in love with Arabic not the oral dialect, mind you, but the classical language. I&#x2019;d studied it since I was a child, of course, as early as I&#x2019;d studied English or French. Yet only in Arabic class were we constantly told that we could not master this most difficult of languages, that no matter how much we studied and practiced, we could not possibly hope to write as well as Mutanabbi, or heaven forbid, the apex of the language, the Quran itself. Teachers indoctrinated students, just as they had been indoctrinated when younger. None of us can rise above being a failure as an Arab, our original sin. <br><br>I&#x2019;d read the Quran and memorized large chunks of it, but all that studying didn&#x2019;t introduce me to the language&#x2019;s magic forced learning and magic are congenital adversaries.<br><br>I was seven when I took my first Quranic class. The teacher, a wide, bespectacled stutterer, would lose her stutter when she recited the Quran; a true miracle, the other teachers claimed.</p><h2>Players Handbook (Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</h2><p>Advanced D &amp; D Players handbook Compiled Information for Players and Dungeon Masters by Gary Gygax.</p><p></p><h2>The Interior Castle or the Mansions</h2><p>This spiritual autobiography was originally intended as a series of addresses to the nuns of the Order of the Discalced Carmelites, the order which St Teresa founded. The book contains advice and direction on themes ranging from self-knowledge and humility to detachment and suffering. St Teresa compares the human soul to a castle, equipped with many mansions. The key to entering this castle is prayer. Following St Teresa&#39;s spiritual pilgrimage, the reader enters the first mansion of humility and then the succeeding manions of practising prayer, meditation, the prayer of quiet, the prayer of union with God, before entering the central mansion where God resides and where the most special spiritual blessings are to be received.</p><p><p><b>Teresa of Avila </b>(1515-1582), also called Saint Teresa of Jesus, was a Spanish nun and one of the great mystics and religious women of the Roman Catholic Church.

All that practice, not to mention the peer pressure, makes for some of the best recipes in town, especially when that town is a culinary mecca like San Francisco. Firehouse Food introduces firehouse life, its brave denizens, and more than 100 of their best recipes. We meet greenhorns and veterans, retirees and local characters, all the while enjoying terrific meals designed to cook up easy and satisfy the whole crew. The recipes reflect the diversity of the San Francisco Fire Department personnel themselves-Latin-American, Asian, African, Italian, Irish, Eastern European-with a melting pot of delectable flavors. From barbecue by the experts to a Pineapple Upside Down Cake just like mom s, these dishes are forgiving enough for anyone to try, and generous enough for everyone to enjoy. With color photographs of meals, downtime, cookery in action, and of course the food itself, Firehouse Food illustrates the daily routine that turns a firehouse into a family.</p><p>George Dolese and Steve Siegelman brought together this wonderful collection from San Francisco s finest.

And with that, authors Dolese (food writer and cookbook photos stylist) and Siegelman (cookbook writer) present meals that can be prepared for either army or family. These recipes, which often reflect the flavor of San Francisco, are as simple as Coleslaw with Pineapple and Dried Cherries (from Marty Verhaeg, Engine 13) or as time-consuming as Pork Mole, which can be prepared two days ahead of time (from Theresa Wolowic, Engine 32). The flavor-intense Villa Gumbo requires a roux and is served by Rich Gibson, whose Station 37, founded in 1915, ranks as one of the oldest. Desserts such as Warm Swiss Almond Apple Cake (from Lt.

Stevenson, Jr. Professor of Language and Literature at Bard College and lives in New York City and Hudson, New York.This beautiful long poem presents Ashbery at his most contradictory: it is both his most Homeric and "narrative" long poem, yet at the same time his most joissant, collage-based work in years. It borrows from the imagery of Henry Darger (1892-1972), an American "outsider" artist who devoted decades to a mammoth, illustrated novel about the plight of the fictional "Vivian" girls. Ashbery's adaptation follows the adventures of dozens of characters with names like Pliable, Bunny, Mr. McPlaster, Uncle Margaret, and FredArecalling "Farm Implements and Rutabegas in Landscape," Ashbery's talismanic Popeye riff from the '70s. The sentences are often short, somewhat "off" ("Trevor his dog came, half jumping."), and they set up deeply bizarre narrative situations: "Hold it, I have an idea, Fred groaned. Now some of you, five at least, must go over in that little shack./ I'll follow with the tidal waves, and see what happens next." Classic Surrealism erupts frequently in well-timed bursts: "The tame suburban landscape excited him./ He had met his match./ Dimples replaced the mollusk with shoe-therapy." Elsewhere, Ashbery jibes obliquely at the epic tradition, laconically laying down the blandest of similes with pseudo-stentorian bluster, while at other moments the meditative, universal Ashberian persona breaks through, with apt sophistication and terrible humanist relevance: "The oblique flute sounded its note of resin./ In time, he said, we all go under the fluted covers/ of this great world, with its spiral dissonances,/ and then we can see, on the other side,/ what the rascals are up to." More memory than dreamAthe never-was memory of constant companionship, of "fun," of names that resonate with mystery (even "Fred")Athe poem recalls a land that was never boring and whose physical environment, while somewhat foreboding, was as safe as the womb and as colorful as Oz. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Big Storm</h2><p>Tracks the path of a huge storm in Spring 1982 from the Pacific coast to New York, explaining why storms move west to east, how weather forecasters follow their progress, and the connection between geography and meteorology.</p><p><b>Bruce Hiscock&nbsp;</b>is the author-illustrator of&nbsp;many children's books, including <i>Ookpik: The Travels fo a Snowy Owl</i>. He lives in Porter Corners, New York.Grade 1-5-In a format similar to his Big Tree (1991) and Big Rock (1988, both Atheneum), Hiscock describes the effects of a storm that hit the United States in the spring of 1982. With simple, well-chosen words, he conveys a wealth of information about weather. While describing the various stages of the storm, the author smoothly weaves clear descriptions of concepts such as cold fronts and atmospheric pressure into the text. The storm is traced over seven days, so readers are able to see how all of the stages fit together and affect one another. Forecasters try to plot where warm and cold fronts will meet and cause dangerous conditions, and the anticipation is truly suspenseful. Hiscock's illustrations are unspectacular but effective, particularly the diagrams. He does not spell out the meanings of various symbols used in several of the weather maps, but because they relate directly to the scene described, they are easy to decipher. The pictures include meteorologists, adults stuck in traffic, and children watching weather reports, playing in the snow, and reacting to the elements in other ways. Gail Gibbons's Weather Words and What They Mean (Holiday, 1990) and Lynda Dewitt's What Will the Weather Be? (HarperCollins, 1991) introduce the topic to the same age group, but The Big Storm is exceptionally thoughtful, well crafted, and involving.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, Alameda County Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Commentary on the American Prayer Book</h2><p>Traces and comments upon the sources, history, and development of each of the rites and formularies of the book from the earliest known forms until the present day.</p><p></p><h2>Abundantly Wild: Collecting And Cooking Wild Edibles Of The Upper Midwest</h2><p>Wild edibles are found almost everywhere, from parks to country lanes to city backyards.

The songs tell of dying longhorns, stampeding cattle, bucking broncos, buffaloes, muleskinners, cowgirls, and hard-fisted companions of the roundup and the chuck wagon.</p><p>Nathan Howard "Jack" Thorp (June 10, 1867 &#x2013; June 4, 1940) was an American collector and writer of cowboy songs and cowboy poetry. Starting in 1889, he collected cowboy material while living in New Mexico. His small book Songs of the Cowboys was published there in 1908. It was the first such book ever published, containing the words to only 23 songs, including the now-classic "The Streets of Laredo" and "Little Joe the Wrangler". A greatly expanded second edition was published in 1921. Today, Thorp is credited with being the first person to take a serious interest in collecting and preserving the homespun ballads of the American West. Thorp was the youngest of three sons of a New York City lawyer and real estate investor. As a child he summered at his brother's ranch in Nebraska, and at nineteen he moved there. Later he moved to New Mexico, where he worked as a cowboy and a civil engineer, operated cattle and sheep ranches, and served as New Mexico's state cattle inspector. He married in 1903, living in Palma (100 miles east of Albuquerque) and Santa Fe before moving closer to Albuquerque in 1935. He died at his home in Alameda, New Mexico, on June 4, 1940.</p><h2>Riverboat Adventures</h2><p>The delightful stories and lavish illustrations in this collecton have also appeared in four separate volumes &#34;Animal Adventure&#34; Series.</p><p></p><h2>Classic baseball cards: The golden years, 1886-1956</h2><p>Classic baseball cards: The golden years, 1886-1956</p><p></p><h2>I Heard Good News Today: Stories for Children</h2><p>The stories in this children&#39;s book show how the Great Commission given by Jesus became a reality through the centuries.

But the stakes are higher than anyone imagines, for the pull of destiny tugs at other souls who are swept into the vortex of the Prophets, remote and timeless beings who have set these events in motion.

This is her first Star Trek novel.<b>1</b> <br> <p> <b>NINE MONTHS AGO</b> <br> <br> </p><p> Far below the cracked ochre wasteland of Harkoum's surface, Iliana Ghemor turned away from the reading screen, her anguish and rage competing for dominance as she wedged the knuckles of her left fist between her teeth. She savored the sensation of her skin breaking against the pressure, the metallic taste of her blood mingling with the salty tears that flowed freely down the cheeks of Kira Nerys. </p><p> <i>Her</i> cheeks. </p><p> <i>Dead,</i> she thought as her eyes traveled tremulously back to the shatterframe monitor atop her desk. <i>They're all dead. And they've been dead for years.</i> Her mother, her father, Entek, the Obsidian Order itself...And now, if this newest intel from her spies was to be believed, even Gul Dukat was gone -- consumed in Bajor's Fire Caves during an arcane confrontation with the Emissary, a battle that had evidently claimed them both. </p><p> In truth, she'd half expected this. From the moment she'd learned the full scope of the Dominion War and the attempted genocide on Cardassia that had marked its end, Iliana had accepted the very real possibility that all the people she'd known in her old life were among the nearly one billion slain. But instead, after scouring the files of Dukat's personal database -- copied from his secret safe house beneath the lunar prison on Letau -- she learned that they'd met far different fates. </p><p> Her mother had been first. Less than a year after Iliana had departed Cardassia for her covert mission to Bajor, Kaleen Ghemor had fallen into a despair from which she had never recovered. She resigned from the judiciary, withdrew from the world, and eventually became gravely ill following a prolonged struggle with a crippling depression. She finally expired in a hospital room seven years after she'd last seen Iliana. </p><p> Corbin Entek met his end three years later, after he'd become one of the highest-ranking strategists of the Obsidian Order, and during a predictably convoluted plot to expose her father's covert involvement with a growing dissident movement on Cardassia. That the eroding certainty of her father's political beliefs had eventually led him to become one of the movement's leaders was a revelation, but it was as nothing compared to the shock of learning that Entek's scheme had involved manipulating Tekeny Ghemor with the promise of restoring his long-lost daughter to him, using a surgically altered Kira Nerys -- the <i>other</i> Kira Nerys -- to convince him that she had finally returned from her assignment on Bajor. </p><p> That her old mentor -- and the architect of her metamorphosis -- had chosen to defile her memory in order to achieve his ends came as little surprise. Entek had done a poor job of concealing his true interest in Iliana during her tutelage, and the things she had heard Dukat say to him at Elemspur on the day of her memory transference left little doubt that Entek had manipulated her from the start, and that his frustrated obsession with her was directly responsible for the course her life had subsequently taken. Fittingly, the farce he had perpetrated against her father had been Corbin's final undoing, though it had thrust Tekeny into exile and had allowed the other Kira to survive unscathed. </p><p> The final insult, however, had come two years later, at the time of her father's death of Yarim Fel syndrome aboard Deep Space 9. The bond that Entek's plan had created between Tekeny and Kira had endured right up until Tekeny Ghemor drew his last breath. He had sought to spend his last days in Kira's company, even sharing with her the final, supremely intimate rite of <i>shri'tal!</i> Had he known that Kira shared responsibility for killing the love of Iliana's life? Was it really possible that he had given up any hope of ever finding his real daughter, and had turned to the creature Iliana had been sent to replace in some pathetic need for a surrogate, just so that he wouldn't have to die alone? </p><p> <i>They gave up on me. All of them.</i> </p><p> It had been no less devastating to learn about the deaths of her Bajoran loved ones. Thanks to the memories of Kira Nerys, Iliana recalled the mortal wound Cardassian soldiers had inflicted upon Kira's father, Taban. But Kira's mother, Meru, had apparently lived for years as Dukat's concubine, long after her daughter had thought she'd died of malnutrition in the refugee camps of Singha. Dead too were Kira's brothers, Pohl and Reon. </p><p> Most of Kira's resistance cell -- the Shakaar -- were gone as well. Some had fallen during the Occupation, like Dakahna Vaas, whose loss had been so painful to Kira that it drove her into a self-destructive spiral from which she had only barely escaped; others had been murdered in recent years by a vengeful Cardassian who'd survived Kira's bombing of Gul Pirak's compound on Bajor -- the same bombing that had killed Iliana's beloved Ataan Rhukal. Ataan's death had driven Iliana to the Obsidian Order in her need to exact justice -- and there she had drawn first blood by killing one of the Order's captured terrorists, Dakahna Vaas. </p><p> Ataan and Vaas. She remembered loving them both. She remembered <i>killing</i> them both. And the terrible symmetry of those memories often seemed too intolerable to contemplate. </p><p> And now to learn that Dukat, too, was dead... </p><p> She would have been the first to admit the source of the new information was dubious -- <i>if</i> she had lacked Kira's appreciation of Bajoran metaphysics. </p><p> The report, filed by members of the Vedek Assembly and now glowing out from her desktop screen, told of an account given by the wife of the Emissary. This Kasidy Yates claimed to have experienced her husband in the aftermath of his final encounter with Dukat, and that he had told her that the gul was lost forever to the very entities he had tried to unleash -- the Pah-wraiths. From a Cardassian perspective, it was utter nonsense. </p><p> But from the perspective of a devout Bajoran, it was an entirely logical and fitting end to the life of the planet's most universally hated enemy. Adding to that the information she'd gleaned from Dukat's own files on Bajoran mysticism and the many inexplicable events of the last eight years, and Iliana could well believe that the inscrutable alien beings who resided within the Bajoran wormhole had spun a complex web that had ensnared many lives, including that of Skrain Dukat. </p><p> And perhaps even her own. </p><p> <i>That's it, isn't it? </i>she thought. Cardassia and Bajor, her life and Kira's, Tekeny and Taban, Kaleen and Meru, Shakaar and Corbin, Vaas and Ataan -- they were all somehow intertwined; entangled by invisible strands that formed the pattern of whatever obscure and intricate tapestry the Prophets were weaving behind their impenetrable curtain of timelessness. </p><p> <i>And the thread of my life? Where does it lead now? How do I make myself whole again? Cardassia lies in ruins. Bajor has no place for me. Vengeance against Dukat is denied me. Entek is long dead. My mother succumbed to her own broken heart. And my father...My father's love was stolen from me forever.</i> </p><p> <i>By Kira -- </i> </p><p> "Nerys?" </p><p> Iliana started, but didn't turn toward the voice, hastily moving instead to close the file on her reader and wipe the tears from her face. </p><p> "What is it?" she asked sharply. </p><p> She sensed Shing-kur's hesitation. Ever since they'd broken out of Letau, together with several other inmates, the Kressari had been her devoted right hand, and she'd had the clearest understanding of everything that Iliana had endured these last two decades. </p><p> Shing-kur alone knew that Iliana was not the Bajoran she appeared to be. But she seemed to appreciate nonetheless Iliana's all-consuming need, after fifteen years of physical and psychological torture in Dukat's private dungeon, to cling to the identity of the Bajoran woman that she should have replaced -- the woman whose identity was the only one that had any meaning to her now. Consequently, during the months since their escape to Harkoum, Shing-kur had become acutely sensitive to Iliana's moods, and it had to be obvious to her now that she had intruded upon Iliana at a moment of acute vulnerability. </p><p> "Well?" Iliana demanded. "Out with it!" </p><p> The Kressari seemed to take the hint, though she gave no further sign that she thought anything was amiss. "There's been news out of Bajor." </p><p> Her interest piqued, Iliana turned her head halfway toward Shing-kur, so that the Kressari would see her profile. "What sort of news?" </p><p> Shing-kur's voice carried an air of possibility. "There's a Jem'Hadar soldier aboard Deep Space 9." <br> </p><p> Harkoum proved to be everything Iliana could have hoped for, and more: Dukat's secret Dominion transporter on Letau had deposited her band of fugitives deep within the abysmal Grennokar Detention Center. This was one of many underground secret prison installations that the Obsidian Order had quietly maintained over the last century, until Cardassia finally abandoned the remote planet for good. Rumor had it that mummified corpses still resided in many of those forsaken facilities, and that the so-called enemies of the state who had been incarcerated here at the end of the Order's reign -- many of them having served as test subjects for the Order's medical research initiatives -- had simply been left to die in their locked subterranean cells. Iliana had tried to imagine what it must have been like for those poor souls, caged and starving, their ever-weakening screams for help and rescue going unheard until they had at last faded into eternal silence. </p><p> But if those rumors were true, then Grennokar was a notable exception to current Cardassian policy. The initial search that she and her cohorts had made of the facility showed considerable evidence of <i>recent</i> use, which appeared to have ended both suddenly and disastrously. Between the detention center's still-intact records, which had included copies of Dukat's personal files, it hadn't taken long to piece together what had happened here, or why Dukat had taken such an interest in this place that he had used the Dominion su...</p></p><h2>To Be a Machine: Adventures Among Cyborgs, Utopians, Hackers, and the Futurists Solving the Modest Problem of Death</h2><p><b>&#x201c;This gonzo-journalistic exploration of the Silicon Valley techno-utopians&#x2019; pursuit of escaping mortality is a breezy romp full of colorful characters.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review </i>(Editor's Choice)<br></b><br>Transhumanism is a movement pushing the limits of our bodies&#x2014;our capabilities, intelligence, and lifespans&#x2014;in the hopes that, through technology, we can become something better than ourselves.

As long as we have been telling stories, we have been telling them about the desire to escape our human bodies, to become something other than the animals we are. In our oldest written narrative, we find the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, who, distraught by the death of a friend and unwilling to accept that the same fate lies in store for him, travels to the far edge of the world in search of a cure for mortality. Long story short: no dice. Later, we find Achilles&#x2019; mother dipping him in the Styx in an effort to render him invulnerable. This, too, famously, does not pan out.<br><br>See also: Daedalus, improvised wings.<br><br>See also: Prometheus, stolen divine fire.<br><br>We exist, we humans, in the wreckage of an imagined splendor. It was not supposed to be this way: we weren&#x2019;t supposed to be weak, to be ashamed, to suffer, to die. We have always had higher notions of ourselves. The whole setup&#x2014;garden, serpent, fruit, banishment&#x2014;was a fatal error, a system crash. We came to be what we are by way of a Fall, a retribution. This, at least, is one version of the story: the Christian story, the Western story. The point of which, on some level, is to explain ourselves to ourselves, to account for why it&#x2019;s such a raw deal, this unnatural nature of ours.<br><br>&#x201c;A man,&#x201d; wrote Emerson, &#x201c;is a god in ruins.&#x201d;<br><br>Religion, more or less, arises out of this divine wreckage. And science, too&#x2014;religion&#x2019;s estranged half sibling&#x2014;addresses itself to such animal dissatisfactions. In The Human Condition, writing in the wake of the Soviet launch of the first space satellite, Hannah Arendt reflected on the resulting sense of euphoria about escaping what one news�paper report called &#x201c;men&#x2019;s imprisonment to the earth.&#x201d; This same yearning for escape, she wrote, manifested itself in the attempt to create superior humans from laboratory manipulations of germ plasm, to extend natural life spans far beyond their current limits. &#x201c;This future man,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;whom the scientists tell us they will produce in no more than a hundred years, seems to be possessed by a rebellion against human existence as it has been given, a free gift from nowhere (secularly speaking), which he wishes to exchange, as it were, for something he has made himself.&#x201d;<br><br>A rebellion against human existence as it has been given: this is as good a way as any of attempting to encapsulate what follows, to characterize what motivates the people I came to know in the writing of this book. These people, by and large, identify with a movement known as transhumanism, a movement predicated on the conviction that we can and should use technology to control the future evolution of our species. It is their belief that we can and should eradicate aging as a cause of death; that we can and should use technology to augment our bodies and our minds; that we can and should merge with machines, remaking ourselves, finally, in the image of our own higher ideals. They wish to exchange the gift, these people, for something better, something man-�made. Will it pan out? That remains to be seen.<br><br>I am not a transhumanist. That much is probably apparent, even at this early stage of the proceedings. But my fascination with the movement, with its ideas and its aims, arises out of a basic sympathy with its premise: that human existence, as it has been given, is a suboptimal system.<br><br>In an abstract sort of way, this is something I had always believed to be the case, but in the immediate aftermath of the birth of my son, I came to feel it on a visceral level. The first time I held him, three years ago now, I was overcome by a sense of the fragility of his little body&#x2014;a body that had just emerged, howling and trembling and darkly smeared with blood, out of the trembling body of his mother, from whom many hours of fanatical suffering and exertion had been required to deliver him into the world. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that there ought to be a better system. I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that, at this late stage, we should be beyond all this.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s a thing you should not do as a new father, as you perch uneasily on a leatherette maternity ward chair beside your sleeping infant and his sleeping mother: you should not read a newspaper. I did this, and I regretted it. I sat in the postnatal ward of the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin, turning the pages of The Irish Times in gradually mounting horror, browsing through a catalog of human perversity&#x2014;of massacres and rapes, of cruelties casual and systemic: splintered dispatches from a fallen world&#x2014;and wondered about the wisdom of bringing a child into this mess, this species. (I seem to remember having a mild head cold at the time; this would not have helped matters.)<br><br>Among its many other effects, becoming a parent forces you to think about the nature of the problem&#x2014;which is, in a lot of ways, the problem of nature. Along with all the other horrors and perversities of the broader human context, the realities of aging and sickness and mortality become suddenly inescapable. Or they did for me, at any rate. And for my wife, too, whose existence was so much more entangled with our son&#x2019;s in those early months, and who said something during that time that I will never forget. &#x201c;If I had known how much I was going to love him,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I would have had him.&#x201d; The frailty is the thing, the vulnerability. This infirmity, this doubtful convalescence we refer to, for want of a better term, as the human condition. Condition: an illness or other medical problem.<br><br>For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.<br><br>In hindsight, it seems like more than mere coincidence that this was the period during which I became obsessed with an idea I&#x2019;d first encountered close to a decade previously, and which was now beginning to consume my thoughts&#x2014;the idea that this condition might not be our ineluctable fate. That like nearsightedness or smallpox, it might be set to rights by the intervention of human ingenuity. I was obsessed, that is, for the same reason as I had always been obsessed by the story of the Fall, and the notion of original sin: because it expressed something profoundly true about the deepest strangeness of being human, our inability to accept ourselves, our capacity to believe we might be redeemed of our nature.<br><br>Early on in the pursuit of this obsession&#x2014;a pursuit that had, at that point, yet to lead beyond the Internet into what is fondly referred to as the &#x201c;real world&#x201d;&#x2014;I came upon a strange and provocative text entitled &#x201c;A Letter to Mother Nature.&#x201d; It was, as its name suggested, a kind of epistolary manifesto addressed to the anthropomorphic figure to whom, for the sake of clarity, the creation and husbandry of the natural world is often attributed. The text, in an initial tone of mild passive aggression, began by thanking Mother Nature for her mostly solid work on the project of humanity thus far, for raising us from simple self-�replicating chemicals to trillion-�celled mammals with the capacity for self-�understanding and empathy. The letter then smoothly transitioned into full J&#x2019;accuse mode, briefly outlining some of the more shoddy workmanship evident in the functioning of Homo sapiens: the vulnerability to disease and injury and death, for instance, the ability to function only in highly circumscribed environmental conditions, the limited memory, the notoriously poor impulse control.<br><br>The author&#x2014;addressing Mother Nature as the collective voice of her &#x201c;ambitious human offspring&#x201d;&#x2014;then proposed a total of seven amendments to &#x201c;the human constitution.&#x201d; We would no longer consent to live under the tyranny of aging and death, but would use the tools of biotechnology to &#x201c;endow ourselves with enduring vitality and remove our expiration date.&#x201d; We would augment our powers of perception and cognition through technological enhancements of our sense organs and our neural capacities. We would no longer submit to being the products of blind evolution, but would rather &#x201c;seek complete choice of bodily form and function, refining and augmenting our physical and intellectual abilities beyond those of any human in history.&#x201d; And we would no longer be content to limit our physical, intellectual, and emotional capacities by remaining confined to carbon-�based biological forms.<br><br>This &#x201c;Letter to Mother Nature&#x201d; was the clearest and most provocative statement of transhumanist principles I had encountered, and its epistolary conceit captured something crucial about what made the movement so strange and compelling to me&#x2014;it was direct, and audacious, and it pushed the project of Enlightenment humanism to such radical extremes that it threatened to obliterate it entirely. There was, I felt, a whiff of madness about the whole enterprise, but it was a madness that revealed something fundamental about what we thought of as reason. The letter was, I learned, the work of a man who went by the thematically consistent name Max More&#x2014;an Oxford-�educated philosopher who turned out to be one of the central figures in the transhumanist movement.<br><br>There was, I came to see, no one accepted or canonical version of this movement; but the more I read about it, and the more I came to understand the views of its adherents, the more I understood it as resting on a mechanistic view of human life&#x2014;a view that human beings were devices, and that it was our duty and our destiny to become better versions of the devices that we were: more efficient, more powerful, more useful.<br><br>I wanted to know what it meant to think of yourself, and more broadly your species, in such instrumentalist terms. And I wanted to know more specific things: I wanted to know, for instance, how you might go about becoming a cyborg. I wanted to know how you might upload your mind into a computer or some other hardware, with the aim of existing eternally as code. I wanted to know what it would mean to think of yourself as no more or less than a complex pattern of information, as no more or less than code. I wanted to learn what robots might disclose about our understanding of ourselves and our bodies. I wanted to know how likely artificial intelligence was to redeem or annihilate our species. I wanted to know what it might be like to have faith in technology sufficient to allow a belief in the prospect of your own immortality. I wanted to learn what it meant to be a machine, or to think of yourself as such.<br><br>And I did, I assure you, arrive at some answers to these questions along the way; but in investigating what it meant to be a machine, I must tell you that I also wound up substantially more confused than I already was about what it meant to be a human being. More goal-�oriented readers should be advised, therefore, that this book is as much an investigation of that confusion as it is an analysis of those learnings.<br><br>A broad definition: transhumanism is a liberation movement advocating nothing less than a total emancipation from biology itself. There is another way of seeing this, an equal and opposite interpretation, which is that this apparent liberation would in reality be nothing less than a final and total enslavement to technology. We will be bearing both sides of this dichotomy in mind as we proceed.<br><br>For all the extremity of transhumanism&#x2019;s aims&#x2014;the convergence of technology and flesh, for instance, or the uploading of minds into machines&#x2014;the above dichotomy seemed to me to express something fundamental about the particular time in which we find ourselves, in which we are regularly called upon to consider how technology is changing everything for the better, to acknowledge the extent to which a particular app or platform or device is making the world a better place. If we have hope for the future&#x2014;if we think of ourselves as having such a thing as a future&#x2014;it is predicated in large part on what we might accomplish through our machines. In this sense, trans�humanism is an intensification of a tendency already inherent in much of what we think of as mainstream culture, in what we may as well go ahead and call capitalism.<br><br>And yet the inescapable fact of this aforementioned moment in history is that we, and these machines of ours, are presiding over a vast project of annihilation, an unprecedented destruction of the world we have come to think of as ours. The planet is, we are told, entering a sixth mass extinction: another Fall, another expulsion. It seems very late in the day, in this dismembered world, to be talking about a future.<br><br>One of the things that drew me to this movement, therefore, was the paradoxical force of its anachronism. For all that transhumanism presented itself as resolutely oriented toward a vision of a world to come, it felt to me almost nostalgically evocative of a human past in which radical optimism seemed a viable position to take with respect to the future. In the way it looked forward, transhumanism seemed, somehow, always to be facing backward.</p><h2>Bilder Aus Amerika - Eine Reise durch das schwarze Amerika</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>Sigfusson�s Roads</h2><p><p>Here was a man who had done it all with winter roads.
